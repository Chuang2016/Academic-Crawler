Multiplex families with multiple affected individuals may be enriched for disease-associated variants of this class compared to unrelated populations. We present an exome array study of schizophrenia in 99 multiplex families (n=341, including 118 cases) from the Western Australian Family Study of Schizophrenia (WAFSS). Compared to 55,726 individuals from the DIAGRAM sample not selected for schizophrenia, overall allele frequency of exome variants was higher in the WAFSS (P&lt;2.2E-16). This was pronounced in variants nominally associated (P&lt;0.05) with schizophrenia. Genes harbouring variants present only in WAFSS cases were enriched (FDR-corrected P=0.05) for membership of the 'extracellular matrix (ECM) - receptor interaction' biological pathway, adding to evidence that processes affecting the composition or turnover of ECM may contribute to neuropsychiatric disease. We did not find individual variants significantly associated with schizophrenia, although like previous studies, power to detect associations of small effect size was low. Cases did not exhibit a higher burden of variants compared to their unaffected relatives and the finding of previous exome chip studies of unrelated samples that 'schizophrenia gene-sets' were enriched for case-only variants was not replicated in the WAFSS. The higher frequency of moderately rare, exonic variants in these multiplex families compared to a population-based sample may account for some of their genetic liability to schizophrenia, and adds to evidence for a role of exome array variants from previous studies of unrelated samples.</abstracttext>]",['https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0920-9964(16)30565-5']

The dramatic evolution of the mass analysis method of genomes, transcripts, and proteins has enabled a comprehensive analysis of molecular events underlying diseases, and these methodologies have also been applied to pediatric LUTD. In genetic analyses of syndromes underlying daytime incontinence, urofacial (Ochoa) syndrome may be creating a prototype of a new research approach. Nocturnal enuresis has long been studied genetically, and several candidate loci have been reported. However, the pursuit for enuresis genes has been abandoned partly because genetic association and enuresis phenotype (bladder or renal type) could not be linked. Enuresis associated with diabetes insipidus has provided new insights into the etiology of the diseases. A chronobiological approach may shed new light on this area. Posterior urethral valves and neurogenic bladders have attracted the interest of pediatric urologists to the smooth muscle biology of the bladder. Bladder exstrophy and cloacal anomalies are rare but major anomalies caused by defective urorectal development and have recently been studied from a genetic standpoint.

"Singhal A, Simmons M, Lu Z.",2016,27902695,Text Mining Genotype-Phenotype Relationships from Biomedical Literature for Database Curation and Precision Medicine.,PLoS computational biology,"[<abstracttext>The practice of precision medicine will ultimately require databases of genes and mutations for healthcare providers to reference in order to understand the clinical implications of each patient's genetic makeup. Although the highest quality databases require manual curation, text mining tools can facilitate the curation process, increasing accuracy, coverage, and productivity. However, to date there are no available text mining tools that offer high-accuracy performance for extracting such triplets from biomedical literature. In this paper we propose a high-performance machine learning approach to automate the extraction of disease-gene-variant triplets from biomedical literature. Our approach is unique because we identify the genes and protein products associated with each mutation from not just the local text content, but from a global context as well (from the Internet and from all literature in PubMed). Our approach also incorporates protein sequence validation and disease association using a novel text-mining-based machine learning approach. We extract disease-gene-variant triplets from all abstracts in PubMed related to a set of ten important diseases (breast cancer, prostate cancer, pancreatic cancer, lung cancer, acute myeloid leukemia, Alzheimer's disease, hemochromatosis, age-related macular degeneration (AMD), diabetes mellitus, and cystic fibrosis). We then evaluate our approach in two ways: (1) a direct comparison with the state of the art using benchmark datasets; (2) a validation study comparing the results of our approach with entries in a popular human-curated database (UniProt) for each of the previously mentioned diseases. In the benchmark comparison, our full approach achieves a 28% improvement in F1-measure (from 0.62 to 0.79) over the state-of-the-art results. For the validation study with UniProt Knowledgebase (KB), we present a thorough analysis of the results and errors. Across all diseases, our approach returned 272 triplets (disease-gene-variant) that overlapped with entries in UniProt and 5,384 triplets without overlap in UniProt. Analysis of the overlapping triplets and of a stratified sample of the non-overlapping triplets revealed accuracies of 93% and 80% for the respective categories (cumulative accuracy, 77%). We conclude that our process represents an important and broadly applicable improvement to the state of the art for curation of disease-gene-variant relationships.</abstracttext>]","['http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005017', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmid/27902695/']"

Dietary restriction (DR) regimens have been shown to extend health span and lifespan in many animal models including primates. Identifying biomarkers predictive of clinical benefits of treatment is one of the primary goals of precision medicine. To monitor the clinical outcomes of DR interventions in humans, several biomarkers are commonly adopted. However, a validated link between the behaviors of such biomarkers and DR effects is lacking at present time. Through a systematic analysis of human intervention studies, we evaluated the effect size of DR (i.e. calorie restriction, very low calorie diet, intermittent fasting, alternate day fasting) on health-related biomarkers. We found that DR is effective in reducing total and visceral adipose mass and improving inflammatory cytokines profile and adiponectin/leptin ratio. By analysing the levels of canonical biomarkers of healthy aging, we also validated the changes of insulin, IGF-1 and IGFBP-1,2 to monitor DR effects. Collectively, we developed a useful platform to evaluate the human responses to dietary regimens low in calories.</abstracttext>]",['http://www.impactaging.com/full/101122']

Seyhan AA.,2015,25765998,microRNAs with different functions and roles in disease development and as potential biomarkers of diabetes: progress and challenges.,Molecular bioSystems,"[<abstracttext>Biomarkers provide information on early detection of diseases, in determining individuals at risk of developing complications or subtyping individuals for disease phenotypes. In addition, biomarkers may lead to better treatment strategies, personalized therapy, and improved outcome. A major gap in the field of biomarker development is that we have not identified appropriate (minimally invasive, life-style independent and informative) biomarkers for the underlying disease process(es) that can be measured in readily accessible samples (e.g. serum, plasma, blood, urine). miRNAs function as regulators in wide ranging cellular and physiological functions and also participate in many physiopathological processes and thus have been linked to many diseases including diabetes, metabolic and cardiovascular diseases, cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, and autoimmunity. Many miRNAs have been shown to have predictive value as potential biomarkers in a variety of diseases including diabetes, which are detectable in some instances many years before the manifestation of disease. Although some technical challenges still remain, due to their availability in the circulation, relative stability, and ease of detection; miRNAs have emerged as a promising new class of biomarkers to provide information on early detection of disease, monitoring disease progression, in determining individual's risk of developing complications or subtyping individuals for disease phenotypes, and to monitor response to therapeutic interventions. As a final note, most of the miRNAs reported in the literature have not yet been validated in sufficiently powered and longitudinal studies for specificity for that particular disease. </abstracttext>]",['http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5mb00064e']

The traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) can stratify the diabetic patients based on their different TCM syndromes and, thus, allow a personalized treatment. Metabolomics is able to provide metabolite biomarkers for disease subtypes. In this study, we applied a metabolomics approach using an ultraperformance liquid chromatography (UPLC) coupled with quadruple-time-of-flight (QTOF) mass spectrometry system to characterize the metabolic alterations of different TCM syndromes including excess and deficiency in patients diagnosed with diabetes mellitus (DM). We obtained a snapshot of the distinct metabolic changes of DM patients with different TCM syndromes. DM patients with excess syndrome have higher serum 2-indolecarboxylic acid, hypotaurine, pipecolic acid, and progesterone in comparison to those patients with deficiency syndrome. The excess patients have more oxidative stress as demonstrated by unique metabolite signatures than the deficiency subjects. The results provide an improved understanding of the systemic alteration of metabolites in different syndromes of DM. The identified serum metabolites may be of clinical relevance for subtyping of diabetic patients, leading to a personalized DM treatment. </abstracttext>]","['https://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2015/350703', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmid/25667595/']"

The aim of this study was to examine our own institutional experience with GH adenomas and correlate how subtype related to clinical parameters as well as response to surgery and medical therapies. A retrospective chart review of 101 acromegalic patients operated by a single neurosurgeon was performed. Clinical data were correlated with histologic subtype and disease control, as defined by IGF-1 levels, and random growth hormone levels in response to surgery and/or medical therapies. SG tumors, compared to DG, occurred in younger patients (p = 0.0010), were 3-fold larger (p = 0.0030) but showed no differences in tumor-invasion characteristics (p = 0.12). DG tumors had a higher rate of remission in response to surgery compared to SG, 65.7 vs. 14.3 % (p &lt; 0.0001), as well as to medical therapy with SSAs (68.8 % for DG vs. 28.6 % for SG tumors; p = 0.028).

Although Legionella infections can mostly be assigned to the emission sources, uncertainty exists about the release and distribution into the air, the occurrence of the respirable virulent form and the level of the infective concentration. Our study aimed to evaluate studies on legionellosis outbreaks attributed to cooling towers published within the last 11 years by means of a systematic review of the literature. 19 legionellosis outbreaks were identified affecting 12 countries. Recurring events were observed in Spain and Great Britain. In total, 1609 confirmed cases of legionellosis and a case-fatality rate of approximately 6% were reported. Duration of outbreaks was 65 days on average. For diagnosis the urinary antigen test was mainly used. Age, smoking, male sex and underlying diseases (diabetes, immunodeficiency) could be confirmed as risk factors. Smoking and underlying diseases were the most frequent risk factors associated with legionellosis in 11 and 10 of the 19 studies, respectively. The meteorological conditions varied strongly. Several studies reported a temporal association of outbreaks with inadequate maintenance of the cooling systems. A match of clinical and environmental isolates by serotyping and/or molecular subtyping could be confirmed in 84% of outbreaks. Legionella-contaminated cooling towers as environmental trigger, in particular in the neighbourhood of susceptible individuals, can cause severe health problems and even death. To prevent and control Legionella contamination of cooling towers, maintenance actions should focus on low-emission cleaning procedures of cooling towers combined with control measurements of water and air samples. Procedures allowing rapid detection and risk assessment in the case of outbreaks are essential for adequate public health measures. Systematic registration of cooling towers will facilitate the identification of the source of outbreaks and help to shorten their duration. </abstracttext>]",['https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1438-4639(13)00114-4']

It is the most common genetic disease in whites. Men have a 24-fold increased rate of iron-overload disease compared with women. Persons who are homozygous for the HFE gene mutation C282Y comprise 85 to 90 percent of phenotypically affected persons. End-organ damage or clinical manifestations of hereditary hemochromatosis occur in approximately 10 percent of persons homozygous for C282Y. Symptoms of hereditary hemochromatosis are nonspecific and typically absent in the early stages. If present, symptoms may include weakness, lethargy, arthralgias, and impotence. Later manifestations include arthralgias, osteoporosis, cirrhosis, hepatocellular cancer, cardiomyopathy, dysrhythmia, diabetes mellitus, and hypogonadism. Diagnosis requires confirmation of increased serum ferritin levels and transferrin saturation, with or without symptoms. Subtyping is based on genotypic expression. Serum ferritin measurement is the most useful prognostic indicator of disease severity. Liver biopsy is performed to stage the degree of fibrosis with severe ferritin elevation or transaminitis, or to diagnose nonclassical hereditary hemochromatosis in patients with other genetic defects. Treatment of hereditary hemochromatosis requires phlebotomy, and the frequency is guided by serial measurements of serum ferritin levels and transferrin saturation. Iron avidity can result from overtreatment. If iron avidity is not suspected, it may mimic undertreatment with persistently elevated transferrin saturation. Dietary modification is generally unnecessary. Universal screening for hereditary hemochromatosis is not recommended, but testing should be performed in first-degree relatives of patients with classical HFE-related hemochromatosis, those with evidence of active liver disease, and patients with abnormal iron study results. Screening for hepatocellular carcinoma is reserved for those with hereditary hemochromatosis and cirrhosis.</abstracttext>]",['http://www.aafp.org/link_out?pmid=23418762']

Classifying subtypes accurately using genomic data will provide individualized treatments to target-specific disease subtypes. However, it is often difficult to obtain satisfactory classification accuracy using only one type of data, because the subtypes of a disease can exhibit similar patterns in one data type. Fortunately, multiple types of genomic data are often available due to the rapid development of genomic techniques. This raises the question on whether the classification performance can significantly be improved by combining multiple types of genomic data. In this article, we classified four subtypes of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) with multiple types of genome-wide data (e.g., mRNA and miRNA expression) from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project. We proposed a multi-class compressed sensing-based detector (MCSD) for this study. The MCSD was trained with data from TCGA and then applied to subtype GBM patients using an independent testing data. We performed the classification on the same patient subjects with three data types, i.e., miRNA expression data, mRNA (or gene expression) data, and their combinations. The classification accuracy is 69.1% with the miRNA expression data, 52.7% with mRNA expression data, and 90.9% with the combination of both mRNA and miRNA expression data. In addition, some biomarkers identified by the integrated approaches have been confirmed with results from the published literatures. These results indicate that the combined analysis can significantly improve the accuracy of classifying GBM subtypes and identify potential biomarkers for disease diagnosis.</abstracttext>]","['https://bsb.eurasipjournals.com/content/2013/1/2', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmid/23311594/']"

Metagenomic analyses from large cohorts of patients have uncovered tight correlations between bacterial genes within our intestine and mouth and diseases such as metabolic diseases, diabetes, obesity, some liver diseases, kidney and heart failure as well as vascular diseases. Some causal mechanisms have been proposed in rodents and can set the soil for novel therapeutic strategies that could interfere with both the microbes and the corresponding host targets.</abstracttext>]",['http://publications.edpsciences.org/10.1051/medsci/20163211010']

We investigated alterations of urinary microbiota in Chinese female T2DM patients, and explored the associations between urinary microbiota and a patient's fasting blood glucose (FBG), urine glucose (UGLU), age, menstrual status, and body mass index (BMI). Midstream urine was collected from 70 female T2DM patients and 70 healthy females. Microbial diversity and composition were analyzed using the Illumina MiSeq sequencing platform by targeting the hypervariable V3-V4 regions of the 16S rRNA gene. We found that bacterial diversity was decreased in T2DM patients. Increased Actinobacteria phylum was positively correlated with FBG, UGLU, and BMI; Lactobacillus abundance decreased with age and menopause; and increased Lactobacillus correlated positively with FBG and UGLU. Decreased Akkermansia muciniphila was associated with FBG and UGLU. Escherichia coli abundance did not differ between the two cohorts. Carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism was reduced in T2DM patients, which were associated with bacterial richness indices such as Chao1 and ACE.

This makes the dog an obvious model for studying the pathogenesis of pituitary-dependent hyperadrenocorticism. Despite certain similarities identified at the molecular level, the question still remains whether the two species have a shared oncogenetic background. Recently, hotspot recurrent mutations in the gene encoding for ubiquitin specific protease 8 (USP8) have been identified as the main driver behind the formation of ACTH-secreting pituitary adenomas in humans.

With a very high number of sequence variants, a naÃ¯ve multiple hypothesis threshold correction hinders the identification of reliable associations by the overreduction of statistical power. In this report, we examine 2 alternative approaches to improve the statistical power of a whole genome association study to detect reliable genetic associations. The approaches were tested using the Genetic Analysis Workshop 19 (GAW19) whole genome sequencing data. The first tested method estimates the real number of effective independent tests actually being performed in whole genome association project by the use of an extreme value distribution and a set of phenotype simulations. Given the familiar nature of the GAW19 data and the finite number of pedigree founders in the sample, the number of correlations between genotypes is greater than in a set of unrelated samples. Using our procedure, we estimate that the effective number represents only 15Â % of the total number of independent tests performed. However, even using this corrected significance threshold, no genome-wide significant association could be detected for systolic and diastolic blood pressure traits. The second approach implements a biological relevance-driven hypothesis tested by exploiting prior computational predictions on the effect of nonsynonymous genetic variants detected in a whole genome sequencing association study. This guided testing approach was able to identify 2 promising single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), 1 for each trait, targeting biologically relevant genes that could help shed light on the genesis of the human hypertension.

In animal models, prebiotics induce favourable changes in the intestinal microbiota, intestinal permeability (IP) and endotoxaemia, which are linked to concurrent improvement in glucose tolerance. This is the first study to investigate the link between IP, glucose tolerance and intestinal bacteria in human type 2 diabetes. In all, twenty-nine men with well-controlled type 2 diabetes were randomised to a prebiotic (galacto-oligosaccharide mixture) or placebo (maltodextrin) supplement (5Â·5 g/d for 12 weeks). Intestinal microbial community structure, IP, endotoxaemia, inflammatory markers and glucose tolerance were assessed at baseline and post intervention. IP was estimated by the urinary recovery of oral 51Cr-EDTA and glucose tolerance by insulin-modified intravenous glucose tolerance test. Intestinal microbial community analysis was performed by high-throughput next-generation sequencing of 16S rRNA amplicons and quantitative PCR. Prebiotic fibre supplementation had no significant effects on clinical outcomes or bacterial abundances compared with placebo; however, changes in the bacterial family Veillonellaceae correlated inversely with changes in glucose response and IL-6 levels (r -0Â·90, P=0Â·042 for both) following prebiotic intake. The absence of significant changes to the microbial community structure at a prebiotic dosage/length of supplementation shown to be effective in healthy individuals is an important finding. We propose that concurrent metformin treatment and the high heterogeneity of human type 2 diabetes may have played a significant role. The current study does not provide evidence for the role of prebiotics in the treatment of type 2 diabetes.</abstracttext>]",['https://www.cambridge.org/core/product/identifier/S0007114516004086/type/journal_article']

Enhancers are marked by histone H3K4 mono- and di-methylation (H3K4me1/2). The tumor suppressor MLL4 (KMT2D) is a major enhancer H3K4 mono- and di-methyltransferase with a partial functional redundancy with MLL3 (KMT2C). However, the functional role of MLL4 enzymatic activity remains elusive. To address this issue, we have generated MLL4 enzyme-dead knock-in (KI) embryonic stem (ES) cells and mice, which carry Y5477A/Y5523A/Y5563A mutations in the enzymatic SET domain of the MLL4 protein. Homozygous MLL4 enzyme-dead KI (Mll4<sup>KI/KI</sup>) mice are embryonic lethal and die around E10.5, which pheno-copies Mll4 knockout (KO) mice. Interestingly, enzyme-dead MLL4 protein in ES cells is highly unstable. Like Mll4 KO ES cells, Mll4<sup>KI/KI</sup> ES cells show reduced levels of H3K4me1/2. Further, we show that ectopic expression of histone H3.3 lysine 4 to methionine (K4M) mutant, which reduces endogenous H3K4 methylation levels in ES cells, decreases protein stability of MLL3 and MLL4 but not that of H3K4 methyltransferases SET1A (KMT2F) and SET1B (KMT2G). Taken together, our findings indicate that MLL4 protein stability is tightly regulated by its H3K4 methyltransferase activity.</abstracttext>]",['https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0022-2836(16)30555-1']

To explain the pleiotropic effects of resveratrol, the molecular targets of this compound have to be identified on the cellular level. Resveratrol induces intracellular signal transduction pathways which ultimately lead to changes in the gene expression pattern of the cells. Here, we review the effect of resveratrol on the activation of the stimulus-responsive transcription factors CREB, AP-1, Egr-1, Elk-1, and Nrf2. Following activation, these transcription factors induce transcription of delayed response genes. The gene products of these delayed response genes are ultimately responsible for the changes in the biochemistry and physiology of resveratrol-treated cells. The activation of stimulus-responsive transcription factors may explain many of the intracellular activities of resveratrol.

Increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the cytosol damage mitochondria, and due to compromised antioxidant signaling system and dysfunctional mitochondria with damaged mitochondrial DNA, ROS continue to pile up, accelerating capillary cell loss. In addition to other cellular and enzymatic defense system, the retina is also equipped with the nuclear erythroid-2-p45-related factor-2 (Nrf2) antioxidant response element signaling pathway, which controls the expression of genes important in detoxification and elimination of ROS. However, in diabetes, its transcriptional activity is impaired, further exacerbating and exposing the retina to elevated stress. Diabetic milieu also alters epigenetic factors responsible for chromatin modifications and gene regulation, and kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1), important in regulating Nrf2-antioxidant signaling axis, is epigenetically modified, impeding nuclear translocation of Nrf2, and this inhibits the transcription of genes with Antioxidant Redox Element. This review discusses antioxidant signaling, especially the role of Nrf2, in diabetic retinopathy, and possible involvement of epigenetic modifications in antioxidant signaling and Nrf2 transcriptional activity. Therapies targeting Nrf2 activation, including epigenetic modifications, could prevent mitochondrial damage and inhibit the development, and progression of this sight-threatening disease which most of the patients get after 20-25 years of diabetes.</abstracttext>]",['https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0891-5849(16)31131-5']
Stroot PG.,2017,28012599,Blood oxidative stress (BLOS) is a secondary host defense system responding normally to anaerobic wound infection and inadvertently to dietary ultra-exogenous sulfide formation (USF).,Medical hypotheses,"[<abstracttext>Blood oxidative stress (BLOS) is the presence of white blood cells and platelets that are generating high levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS). A mathematical model links the level of BLOS or BLOS# and plasma sulfide concentration. An increase in the BLOS# reduces the plasma sulfide concentration. The reported maximum plasma sulfide concentration for defined health conditions were used to calculate the minimum BLOS#. Elevated BLOS generates high plasma concentration of ROS, which triggers multiple responses in the body that protect the host. First, insulin production by the pancreas is inhibited, which results in elevated blood glucose levels. This results in advanced glycation end products (AGE), which thicken the blood vessel wall. Elevated blood glucose levels also increases urination, which reduces the availability of substrates for infectious bacteria. Second, one or more signaling molecules are stimulated to produce vascular hypertrophy resulting in hypertension. Third, the initial stage of atherosclerosis thickens the blood vessel wall while also protecting the inner surface of the blood vessels from localized infection. The first three mechanisms provide added protection against pathogen migration through the blood vessel wall and reduce the cross-sectional area of blood vessels, which increases the retention time (RT) for improved ROS inactivation of pathogens. Fourth, genes expressed in the liver, which are associated with drug oxidation and uptake transport, are inhibited. This inhibition protects the host from any toxins produced by an anaerobic infection. Elevated BLOS also reduces plasma sulfide concentration, which inhibits wound healing and extends aerobic conditions of the wound. The normal induction of BLOS offers a short-term, cascade of several primary mechanisms for secondary defense against anaerobic infection of a wound. Normal induction of BLOS is due to ultra-exogenous sulfide formation (USF) generated by a local anaerobic infection of a wound in the natural environment. The presence of BLOS without infection is indicative of inadvertent dietary induction. Long-term dietary BLOS results in many severe inflammatory diseases and cancers that are common in an ageing population. Glands were identified as more susceptible to cancers caused by long-term dietary BLOS. Variable BLOS levels in patients of clinical trials may also be reducing effectiveness of experimental drugs and causing drug toxicity. If BLOS is confirmed as a secondary defense against infection that is inadvertently triggered by diet, then a large number of common health problems may be treated and managed by apheresis and dietary changes.</abstracttext>]",['https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0306-9877(16)30451-0']

To address the physiological function of TFEB in skeletal muscle, we have used muscle-specific gain- and loss-of-function approaches. Here, we show that TFEB controls metabolic flexibility in muscle during exercise and that this action is independent of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-Œ≥ coactivator1Œ± (PGC1Œ±). Indeed, TFEB translocates into the myonuclei during physical activity and regulates glucose uptake and glycogen content by controlling expression of glucose transporters, glycolytic enzymes, and pathways related to glucose homeostasis. In addition, TFEB induces the expression of genes involved in mitochondrial biogenesis, fatty acid oxidation, and oxidative phosphorylation. This coordinated action optimizes mitochondrial substrate utilization, thus enhancing ATP production and exercise capacity. These findings identify TFEB as a critical mediator of the beneficial effects of exercise on metabolism.</abstracttext>]",['https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1550-4131(16)30581-2']

Global Ldb1 deletion results in early embryonic lethality; thus, we utilized global heterozygous Ldb1<sup>+/-</sup> and inducible Œ≤-cell-specific Ldb1-deficient (Ldb1<sup>ŒîŒ≤-cell</sup>) mice. We assessed glucose and insulin tolerance, body composition, feeding, and energy expenditure during high-fat diet exposure. Brown adipose tissue (BAT) biology was evaluated by thermogenic gene expression and Ldb1 chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis. We found that partial loss of Ldb1 does not impair the maintenance of glucose homeostasis; rather, we observed improved insulin sensitivity in these mice. Partial loss of Ldb1 also uncovered defects in energy expenditure in lean and diet-induced obese (DIO) mice. This decreased energy expenditure during DIO was associated with significantly altered BAT gene expression, specifically Cidea, Elovl3, Cox7a1, and Dio2. Remarkably, the observed changes in energy balance during DIO were absent in Ldb1<sup>ŒîŒ≤-cell</sup> mice, despite a similar reduction in plasma insulin, suggesting a role for Ldb1 in BAT. Indeed, Ldb1 is expressed in brown adipocytes and occupies a regulatory domain of Elovl3, a gene crucial to normal BAT function.

Regenerating islet-derived 2 (Reg2, Reg II, human orthologue Reg1B) gene is normally expressed in pancreatic acinar cells and significantly induced in responses to diabetes, pancreatitis, high-fat diet and during pancreatic regeneration. In order to evaluate the role of endogenous Reg2 production in normal Œ≤-cell function, we characterized Reg2 gene deficient mice normally and when subjected to several pathological challenges. At a young age, Reg2 gene deficiency caused no obvious change in normal islet morphology or glucose tolerance. There was no change in the severity of streptozotocin-induced diabetes or caerulein-induced acute pancreatitis in the Reg2 deficient mice, indicating that the increased Reg2 expression under those conditions was not essential to protect the islet or acinar cells. However, 13-14 months old, aged Reg2 gene deficient mice developed glucose intolerance associated with significantly decreased islet Œ≤-cell ratio and serum insulin level. Similarly, after young mice were fed high-fat diet for 19 weeks, diminished islet mass expansion and serum insulin level were observed in Reg2 deficient vs. wild-type mice. This was associated with a decline in the rate of individual Œ≤-cell proliferation measured by Ki67 labeling.

STAT5 preferentially binds to promoter sequences of cytokine-responsive genes expressed across cell types and to putative enhancers of lineage-specific genes. While chromatin accessibility of STAT5-based enhancers was dependent on cytokine exposure, STAT5-responsive promoters of widely expressed target genes were generally constitutively accessible. While the contribution of STAT5 to enhancers is well established, its role on promoters is poorly understood. To address this, we focused on Socs2, a widely expressed cytokine-sensing gene. Upon deletion of the STAT5 response elements from the Socs2 promoter in mice, cytokine induction was abrogated, while basal activity remained intact.

The lavage fluid was separated into cellular and acellular fractions by centrifugation. Cellular and cell-free DNA (cfDNA) were isolated from each lavage. Two targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) gene panels, one composed of 56 genes and the other of 12 genes, were used for ultra-deep sequencing. To rule out potential NGS-based errors, orthogonal mutation validation was performed using digital PCR and Sanger sequencing. Seven patients were diagnosed with endometrial cancer based on classic histopathologic analysis. Six of these patients had stage IA cancer, and one of these cancers was only detectable as a microscopic focus within a polyp. All seven patients were found to have significant cancer-associated gene mutations in both cell pellet and cfDNA fractions. In the four patients in whom adequate tumor sample was available, all tumor mutations above a specific allele fraction were present in the uterine lavage DNA samples. Mutations originally only detected in lavage fluid fractions were later confirmed to be present in tumor but at allele fractions significantly less than 1%. Of the remaining 95 patients diagnosed with benign or non-cancer pathology, 44 had no significant cancer mutations detected.

Increasing age and post-menopausal status were associated with the presence of these cancer-associated mutations, suggesting the prevalent existence of a premalignant landscape in women without clinical evidence of cancer. Given that a uterine lavage can be easily and quickly performed even outside of the operating room and in a physician's office-based setting, our findings suggest the future possibility of this approach for screening women for the earliest stages of endometrial cancer.

The physiological role of RBP4 is transport of retinol from the liver to peripheral tissues. One of the first events related to the excessive visceral fat accumulation is the development of inflammation followed by hormonal adipose tissue dysfunction, including excessive RBP4 production. Reduced density of the membrane-type glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) is considered as a direct cause for the stimulation of RBP4 release to the circulation by adipocytes. Circulating RBP4 inhibits the signal pathways stimulated by insulin in skeletal muscle cells, resulting in the development of insulin resistance. Drugs stimulating receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated gamma (PPARŒ≥) - thiazolidinediones - inhibit the production of RBP4 by adipose tissue and increase the insulin sensitivity of the tissues. Increased secretion of RBP4 stimulates the expression of adhesion molecules in the endothelial cells, promoting development of atherosclerosis and arterial hypertension. Population studies demonstrated an association between serum RBP4 in the circulation, and the severity of atherosclerosis and risk of the cardiovascular events and type 2 diabetes.

To assess whether this phenotype is predominantly driven by reduced VGF expression in developing and/or adult neurons, or in peripheral endocrine and neuroendocrine tissues, we generated and analyzed conditional VGF knockout mice, obtained by mating loxP-flanked (floxed) Vgf mice with either pan-neuronal Synapsin-Cre- or forebrain alpha-CaMKII-Cre-recombinase-expressing transgenic mice. Adult male and female mice, with conditional ablation of the Vgf gene in embryonic neurons had significantly reduced body weight, increased energy expenditure, and were resistant to diet-induced obesity. Conditional forebrain postnatal ablation of VGF in male mice, primarily in adult excitatory neurons, had no measurable effect on body weight nor on energy expenditure, but led to a modest increase in adiposity, partially overlapping the effect of AAV-Cre-mediated targeted ablation of VGF in the adult ventromedial hypothalamus and arcuate nucleus of floxed Vgf mice (Foglesong et al., 2016), and also consistent with results of icv delivery of the VGF-derived peptide TLQP-21 to adult mice, which resulted in increased energy expenditure and reduced adiposity (Bartolomucci et al., 2006). Because the lean, hypermetabolic phenotype of germline VGF knockout mice is to a great extent recapitulated in Syn-Cre<sup>+/-</sup>,Vgf<sup>flpflox/flpflox</sup> mice, we conclude that the metabolic profile of germline VGF knockout mice is largely the result of VGF ablation in embryonic CNS neurons, rather than peripheral endocrine and/or neuroendocrine cells, and that in forebrain structures such as hypothalamus, VGF and/or VGF-derived peptides play uniquely different roles in the developing and adult nervous system.</abstracttext>]",[]

Complete genome sequencing of the phages revealed that their genome sizes are quite different (168,758 bp for PKO111 and 50,934 bp for PKP126). Their genome annotation results showed that they have no human virulence-related genes, an important safety consideration. In addition, no lysogen-formation gene cluster was detected in either phage genome, suggesting that they are both virulent phages in their bacterial hosts. Based on these results, PKO111 and PKP126 may be good candidates for development of biocontrol agents against members of the genus Klebsiella for therapeutic purposes. A comparative analysis of tail-associated gene clusters of PKO111 and PKP126 revealed relatively low homology, suggesting that they might differ in the way they recognize and infect their specific hosts.</abstracttext>]",[]

Our previous results revealed that mutant Akita proinsulin is triaged by ER-associated degradation (ERAD). We now find that the ER chaperone Grp170 participates in the degradation process by shifting Akita proinsulin from high molecular weight (MW) complexes towards smaller oligomeric species that are competent to undergo ERAD. Strikingly, overexpressing Grp170 also liberates WT proinsulin trapped in these high MW protein complexes, enhancing ERAD of Akita proinsulin, and restoring WT insulin secretion. Our data reveal that Grp170 participates in preparing mutant proinsulin for degradation while enabling WT proinsulin escape from the ER. In principle, selective destruction of mutant proinsulin offers a rational approach to rectify the insulin secretion problem in MIDY.</abstracttext>]",[]
Spallone V.,2016,28032668,Might genetics play a role in understanding and treating diabetic polyneuropathy?,Diabetes/metabolism research and reviews,"[<abstracttext>Despite the high prevalence and impact on quality of life, costs and survival, there are still unresolved issues regarding diabetic polyneuropathy (DPN): the lack of definite knowledge of its pathogenesis; the limited preventive action of glycaemic control in type 2 diabetes; and the unavailability of effective evidence-based disease-modifying treatment. How can genetics provide the tools to address these gaps? Ziegler et al for the GDS Group explore the novel hypothesis that genetic variability in transketolase (TKT) might contribute to susceptibility to DPN in patients with newly diagnosed type 1 and type 2 diabetes (well characterised for DPN). TKT diverges excess glycolytic metabolites from the hexosamine, PKC, and AGE pathways to the pentose-phosphates pathway, with a protective effect against hyperglycaemia-induced damage. Moreover, thiamine and its derivative benfotiamine are among the few disease-modifying agents still under consideration as DPN treatment. The Authors find significant association of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the TKT gene with neuropathic symptoms score and thermal thresholds, in particular in male subjects with type 2 diabetes. Moreover, they measure plasma methylglioxal (a glycating agent, whose availability is hindered by TKT) without however finding a relation with TKT SNPs. The link found between TKT genetic variability and nerve function measures is considered here in the context of DPN genetic studies and of experimental and clinical findings regarding thiamine and benfotiamine. The conclusion is that available data legitimates the decision to maintain focus on both the search for DPN genetic biomarkers and the therapeutic attempt to target thiamine, TKT and methylglyoxal.</abstracttext>]",[]

Serum levels of CTRP3, CTRP13, adiponectin and inflammatory cytokines and their gene expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were determined in 172 subjects categorized as group I (without T2DM and CAD), group II (with CAD but no T2DM), group III (with T2DM but no CAD) and group IV (with T2DM and CAD). Serum levels and gene expression of CTRP3, CTRP13 and adiponectin in the group I were higher compared to other groups. Inflammatory cytokines in the control group were lower than other groups too. CTRP3 serum levels have an independent association with BMI, smoking and CTRP3 gene expression; also CTRP13 serum levels has an independent association with BMI, HDL-C, insulin, HOMA-IR, HbA1c and TNF-Œ±.

Our study therefore was designed to explore the role of SIRT3 on AGEs-induced EPCs dysfunction of. EPCs isolated from healthy adults were stimulated with AGEs and the expression of SIRT3 was assessed. Then, EPCs transfected with ad-SIRT3 or siRNA-SIRT3 were cultured with or without AGEs. EPCs function, including proliferation, migration; expression of manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD), ROS production, and interleukin-8 (IL-8); and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) production were measured. In some experiments, EPCs were pre-cultured with anti-receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) antibody or anti-neutralizing antibody, and then proliferation, migration, expression of MnSOD, ROS production, and IL-8 and VEGF production were measured. Our results showed that SIRT3 expressed in EPCs and AGEs decreased SIRT3 expression. SIRT3 knockdown with siRNA-SIRT3 promoted dysfunction in EPCs whereas SIRT3 activation with ad-SIRT3 strengthened anti-oxidant capacity and protected AGE-impaired dysfunction. Moreover, RAGE may involve in AGEs-decreased SIRT3 expression in EPCs. These data suggested an important role of SIRT3 in regulating EPCs bioactivity.</abstracttext>]",[]

Previous reports suggest that glycans, the most common post-translational modifications, are involved in obesity-related diseases, but what type of glycan regulates adipogenesis during obesity remains unclear. In this study, we first quantified the mRNA levels of 167 genes (encoding 144 glycosyltransferases and 23 related enzymes) in visceral adipose tissues (VATs) from control mice and high fat diet (HFD)-induced obese mice. We found that a gene encoding Œ≤-galactoside Œ±2,6-sialyltransferase-1 (St6gal1), a key enzyme responsible for the biosynthesis of Œ±2,6-linked sialic acid in N-linked glycans, was most downregulated in VATs from obese mice. We confirmed the reduction in Œ±2,6-sialic acid in VATs from obese mice and differentiated adipocyte model 3T3-L1 cells. Using proteomic analysis, integrin-Œ≤1 was identified as one of the target Œ±2,6-sialylated proteins in adipose tissues, and phosphorylation of its downstream molecule focal adhesion kinase (FAK) was found to be decreased after HFD feeding. St6gal1 overexpression in differentiating 3T3-L1 cells inhibited adipogenesis with increased phosphorylation of FAK. Furthermore, St6gal1 knockout mice exhibited increased bodyweight and VAT weight after HFD feeding. The downregulation of St6gal1 during adipogenesis was canceled by treatment with a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor, suggesting an involvement of epigenetic DNA methylation in St6gal1 silencing. Our findings suggest that ST6GAL1 has an inhibitory role in adipogenesis through integrin-Œ≤1 activation, providing new insights into the roles and regulation mechanisms of glycans in adipocytes during obesity.</abstracttext>]",[]

Liver and kidneys are responsible for metabolism of 40-60% of ingested fructose, while the physiological fate of the remaining fructose remains poorly understood. The primary metabolic pathway for fructose includes the fructose-transporting solute-like carrier transport proteins 2a (SLC2a or GLUT), including GLUT5 and GLUT9, ketohexokinase (KHK), and aldolase. Bioinformatic analysis of gene expression encoding these proteins (glut5, glut9, khk, and aldoC, respectively) identifies other organs capable of this fructose metabolism. This analysis predicts brain, lymphoreticular tissue, placenta, and reproductive tissues as possible additional organs for fructose metabolism. While expression of these genes is highest in liver, the brain is predicted to have expression levels of these genes similar to kidney. RNA in situ hybridization of coronal slices of adult mouse brains validate the in silico expression of glut5, glut9, khk, and aldoC, and show expression across many regions of the brain, with the most notable expression in the cerebellum, hippocampus, cortex, and olfactory bulb. Dissected samples of these brain regions show KHK and aldolase enzyme activity 5-10 times the concentration of that in liver. Furthermore, rates of fructose oxidation in these brain regions are 15-150 times that of liver slices, confirming the bioinformatics prediction and in situ hybridization data. This suggests that previously unappreciated regions across the brain can use fructose, in addition to glucose, for energy production.</abstracttext>]",[]

Pancreatic agenesis with absent gallbladder was confirmed when he underwent congenital diaphragmatic hernia and intestinal malrotation repair. A patent ductus arteriosus and pulmonary stenosis were repaired in infancy. Neurocognitive development has been normal. A second pregnancy was terminated due to tetralogy of Fallot and pulmonary hypoplasia secondary to congenital diaphragmatic hernia. The fetus also demonstrated severe pancreatic hypoplasia, gallbladder agenesis and intestinal rotation abnormalities. Despite severe hypoplasia, the pancreas demonstrated normal islet histology. Another sibling was found to have multiple cardiac abnormalities, requiring procedural intervention. Given the proband's spectrum of congenital anomalies, Sanger sequencing of the GATA6 gene was performed, revealing a novel heterozygous c.635_660del frameshift mutation (p.Pro212fs). The mutation is predicted to be pathogenic, resulting in inclusion of a premature stop codon and likely degradation of the gene transcript by nonsense-mediated decay. The abortus and the sibling with the cardiac defect were both found to have the mutation, while the father and remaining sibling were negative. The mother, who is healthy with no evidence of diabetes or cardiac disease, is mosaic for the mutation at a level of 11% in her peripheral leukocytes by next-generation sequencing.</abstracttext>, <abstracttext label=""CONCLUSION"" nlmcategory=""CONCLUSIONS"">We highlight a rare mechanism of pancreatic agenesis, this being only the second report of parental mosaicism for a GATA6 mutation and one of a handful of inherited cases. We also further define the phenotypic variability of GATA6 haploinsufficiency, even in individuals carrying the same mutation. Mutations in GATA6 should be strongly considered in cases of diabetes due to pancreatic hypoplasia or agenesis, and potentially affected family members should be tested regardless of phenotype.</abstracttext>]",[]

Eighty-seven mild cognitive impairment (MCIs) subjects and 135 matched controls (HCs) were employed at baseline, and they underwent functional MRI scans, clinical evaluations and exon sequencings of 20 genes related to brain insulin resistance. A longitudinal study for an average of 35¬†months was performed to assess their cognitive decline over time. By using cognition as the phenotype, we detected genes that modified cognitive impairments, including AKT2, PIK3CB, IGF1R, PIK3CD, MTOR, IDE, AKT1S1 and AKT1. Based on these loci, the mass univariate modeling was utilized to construct the functional network. The MCIs showed disconnections mainly in the cerebellum-frontal-temporal regions, while compensations may occur in frontal-parietal regions to maintain the overall network efficiency. Moreover, the behavioral significance of the network was highlighted, as topological characteristics of the medial temporal lobe and the prefrontal cortex partially determine longitudinal cognitive decline. Our results suggested that the restoration of insulin activity represents a promising therapeutic target for alleviating cognitive decline associated with T2D and AD.</abstracttext>]",[]

Moreover, the early C. elegans embryo is an excellent model to dissect the mitotic processes of nuclear disassembly and reformation with high spatiotemporal resolution. We review here several features of the C. elegans nucleus, including its composition, structure, and dynamics. We also discuss the spatial organization of chromatin and regulation of gene expression and how this depends on tight control of nucleocytoplasmic transport. Finally, the extensive connections of the nucleus with the cytoskeleton and their implications during development are described.

Reduced sensitivity of cells to insulin and impaired insulin signaling in brain neurons participate in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease (AD). The tumor suppressor protein p53 coordinates with multiple cellular pathways in response to DNA damage and cellular stresses. However, prolonged stress conditions unveil deleterious effects of p53-evoked insulin resistance in neurons; enhancement of transcription of pro-oxidant factors, accumulation of toxic metabolites (e.g.: ceramide, products of advanced glycation) and ROS-modified cellular components, together with activation of proapoptotic genes, could finally induce a suicide death program of autophagy/apoptosis in neurons. Recent studies reveal the impact of p53 on expression and processing of several microRNAs (miRs) under DNA damage-inducing conditions. Additionally, the role of miRs in promotion of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes mellitus has been well documented.

Contrary to these effects at organ levels, PACAP null mice exhibit hypersensitivity to insulin. However, this apparent discrepancy remains to be solved. We aimed to clarify the mechanism underlying the antidiabetic phenotype of PACAP null mice. Feeding with high-fat diet (HFD) impaired insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance in wild type mice, whereas these changes were prevented in PACAP null mice. HFD also impaired insulin-induced Akt phosphorylation in the liver in wild type mice, but not in PACAP null mice. Using GeneFishing method, HFD increased the leukocyte common antigen-related (LAR) protein tyrosine phosphatase in the liver in wild type mice. Silencing of LAR restored the insulin signaling in the liver of HFD mice. Moreover, the increased LAR expression by HFD was prevented in PACAP null mice. HFD increased the expression of VPAC1 receptor (VPAC1-R), one of three PACAP receptors, in the liver of wild type mice. These data indicate that PACAP-VPAC1-R signaling induces LAR expression and insulin resistance in the liver of HFD mice.

Only a few studies have investigated DNA methylation of selected candidate genes or a very small fraction of genomic CpG sites in human pancreatic islets, the tissue of primary pathogenic importance for diabetes. Our aim was to characterize the whole-genome DNA methylation landscape in human pancreatic islets, to identify differentially methylated regions (DMRs) in diabetic islets, and to investigate the function of DMRs in islet biology.Here, we performed whole-genome bisulfite sequencing, which is a comprehensive and unbiased method to study DNA methylation throughout the genome on a single nucleotide resolution, in pancreatic islets from donors with T2D and non-diabetic controls. We identified 25,820 DMRs in islets from individuals with T2D. These DMRs cover loci with known islet function e.g. PDX1, TCF7L2 and ADCY5 Importantly, binding sites previously identified by ChIP-seq for islet-specific transcription factors, enhancer regions and different histone marks were enriched in the T2D associated DMRs. We also identified 457 genes, including NR4A3, PARK2, PID1, SLC2A2 and SOCS2 that had both DMRs and significant expression changes in T2D islets. To mimic the situation in T2D islets, candidate genes were overexpressed or silenced in cultured Œ≤-cells. This resulted in impaired insulin secretion, thereby connecting differential methylation to islet dysfunction. We further explored the islet methylome and found a strong link between methylation levels and histone marks. Additionally, DNA methylation in different genomic regions and of different transcript types (i.e. protein-coding, non-coding and pseudogenes) was associated with islet expression levels.Our study provides a comprehensive picture of the islet DNA methylome in both non-diabetic and diabetic individuals and highlights the importance of epigenetic dysregulation in pancreatic islets and T2D pathogenesis.</abstracttext>]",['http://diabetes.diabetesjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=28052964']

Three weeks after corticosterone delivery, there was reduced sensitivity to insulin action measured by insulin tolerance test. Body composition measurements revealed increased fat mass and decreased lean mass. Overt hyperglycemia (&gt;250 mg/dL) manifested 6 weeks after the start of glucocorticoid administration, whereas 100% of the mice receiving the vehicle control remained normoglycemic. This phenotype was fully reversed during the washout phase and readily reproducible across institutions. Relative to the vehicle control group, mice receiving corticosterone had a significant enhancement in pancreatic insulin-positive area, but a marked decrease in CD3<sup>+</sup> cell infiltration. In addition, there were striking increases in both citrate synthase gene expression and enzymatic activity in skeletal muscle of mice in the corticosterone group relative to vehicle control. Moreover, glycogen synthase expression was greatly enhanced, consistent with elevations in muscle glycogen storage in mice receiving corticosterone. Corticosterone-induced hyperglycemia, insulin resistance, and changes in muscle gene expression were all reversed by the end of the washout phase, indicating that the metabolic alterations were not permanent.

Endocrinology,"[<abstracttext>Studies involving adoptive families and twins have demonstrated the genetic basis of hypertension and shown that genetic factors account for about 40% of the variance in blood pressure among individuals. Arterial hypertension is genetically complex: multiple genes influence the blood pressure phenotype through allelic effects from single genes and gene-gene interactions. Moreover, environmental factors also modify the blood pressure phenotype. This complexity explains why the identification of the underlying genes has not been as successful in hypertension as in other diseases (such as type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus). The identification of the genetic determinants of hypertension has been most successful in endocrine forms of hypertension, which have well-defined phenotypes that permit a precise patient stratification into homogeneous cohorts. A promising area for the application of genetic testing to personalized medicine is the prediction of responses and adverse reactions to antihypertensive drugs. The identification of genetic markers of drug response will enable the design of randomized controlled trials in much smaller series of patients than is currently possible, decreasing the costs and times from drug design to clinical use and ultimately providing patients and doctors with a larger number of tools to combat hypertension, the most important risk factor for cardiovascular disease.

Among nuclear receptors (NRs), the orphan NR4A subfamily, which includes Nur77 (NR4A1), Nurr1 (NR4A2) and NOR1 (NR4A3), has recently emerged as a therapeutic target for the treatment of inflammation. Areas covered This review focuses on the capacity of NR4A receptors to counter-regulate the development of the inflammatory response, with a special focus on the molecular transrepression mechanisms. Expert opinion Recent studies have highlighted the role of NR4A receptors as significant regulators of the inflammatory response. NR4A receptors are rapidly induced by inflammatory stimuli, thus suggesting that they are required for the initiation of inflammation. Nevertheless, NR4A anti-inflammatory properties indicate that this acute regulation could be a protective reaction aimed at resolving inflammation in the later stages. Therefore, NR4A receptors are involved in a negative feedback mechanism to maintain the inflammatory balance. However, the underlying mechanisms are not entirely clear. Only a small number of NR4A-target genes have been identified, and the transcriptional repression mechanisms are only beginning to emerge. Despite further research is needed to fully understand the role of NR4A receptors in inflammation, these NRs should be considered as targets for new therapeutic approaches to inflammatory diseases.</abstracttext>]",['http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/14728222.2017.1279146']

Survivin is a gene that has been found to be highly expressed in the most common human tumors, and it is considered to be associated with tumorigenesis. Survivin expression in normal tissue is developmentally downregulated and is undetectable in most terminally differentiated adult tissues. Here, we report that Survivin expression in mature adipocytes from murine white adipose tissue can be highly induced under high-fat diet feeding conditions. During the adipocyte differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes and mesenchymal C3H10T1/2 cells, Survivin expression is gradually decreased and almost undetectable in fully differentiated adipocytes. However, it can be expressed again upon insulin exposure, through the PI3K/mTOR signaling pathway. Nevertheless, Survivin overexpression is sensitive to nutritional deprivation, and expression markedly decreases in response to starvation with Hank's buffered salt solution challenge. The ectopic expression of Survivin downregulates expression of Adrb3 and then decreases the production of cAMP, while Fsp27 protein levels are upregulated as a result of reduced protein degradation. This in turn inhibits isoproterenol-stimulated adipocyte lipolysis. Survivin also attenuates DNA damage related to PARP activation and inhibits TNFŒ±-induced lipolysis, suggesting that Survivin may facilitate adipocyte maintenance in response to inflammatory stimuli. Further studies will be undertaken to determine whether Survivin is critical for lipid storage to maintain metabolic homeostasis in vivo.</abstracttext>]",['http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/cddis.2016.439']

Both insufficient negative selection of self-reactive T cells and impaired development of regulatory T cells preventing effector cell activation are believed to contribute to autoimmunity. Genetic predispositions center around the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II loci involved in antigen presentation, the key determinant of CD4+ T cell activation. Recent studies suggested that variants in the MHC region also exhibit significant non-additive interaction effects. However, collective interactions involving large numbers of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) contributing to such effects are yet to be characterized. In addition, relatively little is known about the cell-type-specificity of such interactions in the context of cellular pathways. Here, we analyzed type 1 diabetes (T1D) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) genome-wide association data sets via large-scale, high-performance computations and inferred collective interaction effects involving MHC SNPs using the discrete discriminant analysis. Despite considerable differences in the details of SNP interactions in T1D and RA data, the enrichment pattern of interacting pairs in reference epigenomes was remarkably similar: statistically significant interactions were epigenetically active in cell-type combinations connecting B cells to T cells and intestinal epithelial cells, with both helper and regulatory T cells showing strong disease-associated interactions with B cells. Our results provide direct genetic evidence pointing to the important roles B cells play as antigen-presenting cells toward CD4+ T cells in the context of central and peripheral tolerance. In addition, they are consistent with recent experimental studies suggesting that the repertoire of B cell-specific self-antigens in the thymus are critical to the effective control of corresponding autoimmune activation in peripheral tissues.</abstracttext>]",['http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0169918']

Our Hmong Genomics Board, consisting of Hmong and non-Hmong professionals, used CBPR principles and built on previous formative research to create and implement culturally and linguistically appropriate informed consent processes for Hmong people at six community venues. The Board chose genetic variants for diabetes risk and warfarin response as relevant to the community. The Institutional Review Board approved aggregate but not individual return of results. Two hundred thirty-seven Hmong participants with mean (range) age of 30.2 (18-81) years and diverse levels of education (22% without and 75% with high-school education) provided saliva for genetic (DNA) analyses. Eighty-five percent of participants agreed to store DNA for future analyses, 82% agreed to share DNA with other researchers, and 78% agreed to be contacted for future studies.

The usage of uncalibrated assays hinders the comparability of SELENOP concentrations and their pathophysiological interpretation across different clinical studies. On this account, we established a new sandwich SELENOP-ELISA and calibrated against a standard reference material (SRM1950). The ELISA displays a wide working range (11.6-538.4¬µg/L), high accuracy (2.9%) and good precision (9.3%). To verify whether SELENOP correlates to total Se and to SELENOP-bound Se, serum samples from healthy subjects and age-selected participants from the Berlin Aging Study II were analyzed by SELENOP-ELISA and Se quantification.

There was a high correlation of total Se and SELENOP concentrations in young and elderly men, and in elderly women, but not in young women, indicating a specific sexual dimorphism in these biomarkers of Se status in young subjects. The Se content of isolated SELENOP was independent of sex and age (mean¬±SD: 5.4¬±0.5).

Beta cells share many phenotypic traits with neurons, and proper beta cell function relies on the activation of several neuronal-like transcription programs. Regulation of gene expression by alternative splicing plays a pivotal role in brain, where it affects neuronal development, function and disease. The role of alternative splicing in beta cells remains unclear, but recent data indicate that splicing alterations modulated by both inflammation and susceptibility genes for diabetes contribute to beta cell dysfunction and death. Here we used RNA sequencing to compare the expression of splicing-regulatory RNA-binding proteins in human islets, brain and other human tissues, and identified a cluster of splicing regulators that are expressed in both beta cells and brain. Four of them, namely Elavl4, Nova2, Rbox1 and Rbfox2 were selected for subsequent functional studies in insulin-producing rat INS-1E, human EndoC-Œ≤H1 cells, and in primary rat beta cells. Silencing of Elavl4 and Nova2 increased beta cell apoptosis, while silencing of Rbfox1 and Rbfox2 increased insulin content and secretion. Interestingly, Rbfox1 silencing modulates the splicing of the actin-remodeling protein gelsolin, increasing gelsolin expression and leading to faster glucose-induced actin depolymerization and increased insulin release. Taken together, these findings indicate that beta cells share common splicing regulators and programs with neurons.

So far disease causing mutations in HSPB1 have been associated with neurodegenerative diseases such as distal hereditary motor neuropathy, Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Most mutations in HSPB1 target its highly conserved Œ±-crystallin domain, while other mutations affect the C- or N-terminal regions or its promotor. Mutations inside the Œ±-crystallin domain have been shown to enhance the chaperone activity of HSPB1 and increase the binding to client proteins. However, the HSPB1-P182L mutation, located outside and downstream of the Œ±-crystallin domain, behaves differently. This specific HSPB1 mutation results in a severe neuropathy phenotype affecting exclusively the motor neurons of the peripheral nervous system. We identified that the HSPB1-P182L mutant protein has a specifically increased interaction with the RNA binding protein poly(C)binding protein 1 (PCBP1) and results in a reduction of its translational repressive activity. RNA immunoprecipitation followed by RNA sequencing on mouse brain lead to the identification of PCBP1 mRNA targets. These targets contain larger 3'- and 5'-UTRs than average and are enriched in an RNA motif consisting of the CTCCTCCTCCTCC consensus sequence. Interestingly, next to the clear presence of neuronal transcripts among the identified PCBP1 targets we identified known genes associated with hereditary peripheral neuropathies and hereditary spastic paraplegias.

It can occur in association with dermatological, systemic and neurological diseases, or be the side effect of certain drugs. However, some patients suffer from chronic idiopathic itch that is frequently ascribed to psychological distress and for which no biomarker is available to date. We investigated three multigenerational families, one of which diagnosed with joint hypermobility syndrome/Ehlers-Danlos syndrome hypermobility type (JHS/EDS-HT), characterized by idiopathic chronic itch with predominantly proximal distribution. Skin biopsy was performed in all eight affected members and revealed in six of them reduced intraepidermal nerve fibre density consistent with small fibre neuropathy. Whole exome sequencing identified two COL6A5 rare variants co-segregating with chronic itch in eight affected members and absent in non-affected members, and in one unrelated sporadic patient with type 1 painless diabetic neuropathy and chronic itch. Two families and the diabetic patient carried the nonsense c.6814G&gt;T (p.Glu2272*) variant and another family carried the missense c.6486G&gt;C (p.Arg2162Ser) variant. Both variants were predicted as likely pathogenic by in silico analyses. The two variants were rare (minor allele frequency &lt; 0.1%) in 6271 healthy controls and absent in 77 small fibre neuropathy and 167 JHS/EDS-HT patients without itch. Null-allele test on cDNA from patients' fibroblasts of both families carrying the nonsense variant demonstrated functional haploinsufficiency due to activation of nonsense mediated RNA decay. Immunofluorescence microscopy and western blotting revealed marked disorganization and reduced COL6A5 synthesis, respectively. Indirect immunofluorescence showed reduced COL6A5 expression in the skin of patients carrying the nonsense variant. Treatment with gabapentinoids provided satisfactory itch relief in the patients carrying the mutations. Our findings first revealed an association between COL6A5 gene and familiar chronic itch, suggesting a new contributor to the pathogenesis of neuropathic itch and identifying a new candidate therapeutic target.</abstracttext>]",['http://brain.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=28073787']

This is also found in maternal micro-nutrition deficiency, especial chromium which is a key glucose regulator. We investigated whether maternal chromium restriction contributes to the development of diabetes in offspring by affecting DNA methylation status in liver tissue. After being mated with control males, female weanling 8-week-old C57BL mice were fed a control diet (CON, 1.19 mg chromium/kg diet) or a low chromium diet (LC, 0.14 mg chromium/kg diet) during pregnancy and lactation. After weaning, some offspring were shifted to the other diet (CON-LC, or LC-CON), while others remained on the same diet (CON-CON, or LC-LC) for 29 weeks. Fasting blood glucose, serum insulin, and oral glucose tolerance test was performed to evaluate the glucose metabolism condition. Methylation differences in liver from the LC-CON group and CON-CON groups were studied by using a DNA methylation array. Bisulfite sequencing was carried out to validate the results of the methylation array. Maternal chromium limitation diet increased the body weight, blood glucose, and serum insulin levels. Even when switched to the control diet after weaning, the offspring also showed impaired glucose tolerance and insulin resistance. DNA methylation profiling of the offspring livers revealed 935 differentially methylated genes in livers of the maternal chromium restriction diet group. Pathway analysis identified the insulin signaling pathway was the main process affected by hypermethylated genes. Bisulfite sequencing confirmed that some genes in insulin signaling pathway were hypermethylated in livers of the LC-CON and LC-LC group. Accordingly, the expression of genes in insulin signaling pathway was downregulated. There findings suggest that maternal chromium restriction diet results in glucose intolerance in male offspring through alterations in DNA methylation which is associated with the insulin signaling pathway in the mice livers.</abstracttext>]",['http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0169889']

"Girard C, Tromas N, Amyot M, Shapiro BJ.",2017,28070563,Gut Microbiome of the Canadian Arctic Inuit.,mSphere,"[<abstracttext>Diet is a major determinant of community composition in the human gut microbiome, and ""traditional"" diets have been associated with distinct and highly diverse communities, compared to Western diets. However, most traditional diets studied have been those of agrarians and hunter-gatherers consuming fiber-rich diets. In contrast, the Inuit of the Canadian Arctic have been consuming a traditional diet low in carbohydrates and rich in animal fats and protein for thousands of years. We hypothesized that the Inuit diet and lifestyle would be associated with a distinct microbiome. We used deep sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene to compare the gut microbiomes of Montrealers with a Western diet to those of the Inuit consuming a range of traditional and Western diets. At the overall microbial community level, the gut microbiomes of Montrealers and Inuit were indistinguishable and contained similar levels of microbial diversity. However, we observed significant differences in the relative abundances of certain microbial taxa down to the subgenus level using oligotyping. For example, <i>Prevotella</i> spp., which have been previously associated with high-fiber diets, were enriched in Montrealers and among the Inuit consuming a Western diet. The gut microbiomes of Inuit consuming a traditional diet also had significantly less genetic diversity within the <i>Prevotella</i> genus, suggesting that a low-fiber diet might not only select against <i>Prevotella</i> but also reduce its diversity. Other microbes, such as <i>Akkermansia</i>, were associated with geography as well as diet, suggesting limited dispersal to the Arctic. Our report provides a snapshot of the Inuit microbiome as Western-like in overall community structure but distinct in the relative abundances and diversity of certain genera and strains. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> Non-Western populations have been shown to have distinct gut microbial communities shaped by traditional diets. The hitherto-uncharacterized microbiome of the Inuit may help us to better understand health risks specific to this population such as diabetes and obesity, which increase in prevalence as many Inuit transition to a Western diet. Here we show that even Inuit consuming a mostly traditional diet have a broadly Western-like microbiome. This suggests that similarities between the Inuit diet and the Western diet (low fiber, high fat) may lead to a convergence of community structures and diversity. However, certain species and strains of microbes have significantly different levels of abundance and diversity in the Inuit, possibly driven by differences in diet. Furthermore, the Inuit diet provides an exception to the correlation between traditional diets and high microbial diversity, potentially due to their transitioning diet. Knowledge of the Inuit microbiome may provide future resources for interventions and conservation of Inuit heritage.</abstracttext>]","['http://dx.doi.org/10.1128/mSphere.00297-16', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmid/28070563/']"

Blood samples were collected for determination of serum vitamin D, calcium, phosphorus, glucose, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase and as primary source for targeted VDR gene sequencing using the Ion Torrent Personal Genome Machine. The variant calling was based on the GATK best practice workflow and annotated using Annovar tool. A total of 1496 unique variants in the whole 101-kb VDR gene were identified. Novel sequence variations not registered in the dbSNP database were found among cases and controls at a rate of 23.1% and 16.6% of total discovered variants, respectively. One disease-associated enhancer showed statistically significant association to low serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D levels (Pearson chi-square P-value=0.009).

However, the causal gene and underlying mechanism for PCOS risk at these loci have not been determined. We hypothesized that analysis of phenotype, gene expression and metformin response as a function of genotype would identify candidate genes and pathways that could provide insight into the underlying mechanism for risk at these loci. To test the hypothesis, subjects with PCOS (n = 427) diagnosed according to the NIH criteria (&lt; 9 menses per year and clinical or biochemical hyperandrogenism) and controls (n = 407) with extensive phenotyping were studied. A subset of subjects (n = 38) underwent a subcutaneous adipose tissue biopsy for RNA sequencing and were subsequently treated with metformin for 12 weeks with standardized outcomes measured. Data were analyzed according to genotype at PCOS risk loci and adjusted for the false discovery rate. A gene variant in the THADA locus was associated with response to metformin and metformin was a predicted upstream regulator at the same locus. Genotype at the FSHB locus was associated with LH levels. Genes near the PCOS risk loci demonstrated differences in expression as a function of genotype in adipose including BLK and NEIL2 (GATA4 locus), GLIPR1 and PHLDA1 (KRR1 locus). Based on the phenotypes, expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL), and upstream regulatory and pathway analyses we hypothesize that there are PCOS subtypes. FSHB, FHSR and LHR loci may influence PCOS risk based on their relationship to gonadotropin levels. The THADA, GATA4, ERBB4, SUMO1P1, KRR1 and RAB5B loci appear to confer risk through metabolic mechanisms. The IRF1, SUMO1P1 and KRR1 loci may confer PCOS risk in development. The TOX3 and GATA4 loci appear to be involved in inflammation and its consequences. The data suggest potential PCOS subtypes and point to the need for additional studies to replicate these findings and identify personalized diagnosis and treatment options for PCOS.</abstracttext>]",['http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0168870']

T cell infiltrates in affected brain tissue and the presence of circulating autoantibodies in some RE patients have indicated that RE may be an autoimmune disease.

Compared with a reference population the allelic frequency of three alleles, DQA1*04:01:01, DQB1*04:02:01, and HLA-C*07:02:01:01 indicated that they might confer susceptibility to the disease. It has been reported that HLA-C*07:02 is a risk factor for Graves disease. Further, eight patients in the study cohort carried HLA-A*03:01:01:01, which has been linked to susceptibility to multiple sclerosis. Four patients carried a combination of three HLA class II alleles that has been linked to type 1 diabetes (DQA1*05:01:01:01~DQB1*02:01:01~DRB1*03:01:01:01), and five patients carried a combination of HLA class II alleles that has been linked to the risk of contracting multiple sclerosis (DQA1*01:02:01:01, DQB1*06:02:01, DRB1*15:01:01:01).

Increase in ROS/RNS concentration results in lipid and protein oxidation and is often associated with onset and/or progression of many cardiovascular disorders. However, interplay between lipid and protein modifications has not been simultaneously studied in detail so far. Biomolecule carbonylation is one of the most common biomarkers of oxidative stress. Using a dynamic model of nitroxidative stress we demonstrated rapid changes in biomolecule carbonylation in rat cardiomyocytes. Levels of carbonylated species increased as early as 15min upon treatment with the peroxynitrite donor, 3-morpholinosydnonimine (SIN-1), and decreased to values close to control after 16h. Total (lipids+proteins) vs. protein-specific carbonylation showed different dynamics, with a significant increase in protein-bound carbonyls at later time points. Treatment with SIN-1 in combination with inhibitors of proteasomal and autophagy/lysosomal degradation pathways allowed confirmation of a significant role of the proteasome in the degradation of carbonylated proteins, whereas lipid carbonylation increased in the presence of autophagy/lysosomal inhibitors. Electrophilic aldehydes and ketones formed by lipid peroxidation were identified and relatively quantified using LC-MS/MS. Molecular identity of reactive species was used for data-driven analysis of their protein targets. Combination of different enrichment strategies with LC-MS/MS analysis allowed identification of more than 167 unique proteins with 332 sites modified by electrophilic lipid peroxidation products. Gene ontology analysis of modified proteins demonstrated enrichment of several functional categories including proteins involved in cytoskeleton, extracellular matrix, ion channels and their regulation.

The latest evaluation, after two years showed a glycated hemoglobin of 6.0% (42 mmol/mol). This mutation is so severe that none of the previously four reported cases were able to switch from insulin to sulphonylurea monotherapy. The Q52R mutation seems to have a chance of positive response to glibenclamide administered every 3-6h instead of the classical 8-12h, in doses around or above 2.5 mg/Kg/day.

"Morgan SJ, Neumann S, Marcus-Samuels B, Gershengorn MC.",2016,28082948,Thyrotropin Stimulates Differentiation Not Proliferation of Normal Human Thyrocytes in Culture.,Frontiers in endocrinology,"[<abstracttext>Although TSH has been suggested to be a proliferative agent for thyrocytes, the effect of TSH on human thyroid cells remains controversial. In particular, most of the reported studies relied primarily on changes in DNA synthesis but have not included measurement of the number of cells. We argue that only a direct count of cell number, demonstrating classical exponential expansion, serves as a valid measurement of proliferation. Thus, although some data support TSH as a proliferative agent, most do not provide conclusive evidence. To generate conclusive evidence with regard to a proliferative effect of TSH in human thyrocytes, we performed various experiments using primary cultures of human thyrocytes. In contrast to previous reports, TSH [¬±insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1)] did not induce proliferation of thyrocytes under a variety of different conditions. However, TSH/IGF-1 cotreatment did upregulate thyroid-specific gene expression including <i>thyroglobulin (TG)</i> and <i>TSHR</i> in a manner consistent with cellular differentiation. Evidence for a proliferative effect of TSH has been used to inform the American Thyroid Association's guidelines for the management of thyroid cancer patients, which include TSH suppression. While these recommendations are admittedly based on low- to moderate-quality evidence, TSH suppression is still widely used. We present data that question the consensus view that TSH promotes proliferation of human thyrocytes (upon which the American Thyroid Association's guidelines are based) and suggest that additional studies, including randomized controlled trials, are warranted to address this important clinical question.</abstracttext>]",[]

We used a high-fat diet (HFD), a methionine-choline-deficient diet (MCDD) and streptozocin (STZ) to establish nonalcoholic fatty liver (NAFL), nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and NAFL+type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in rat models, respectively. Transcriptomics and metabolomics analyses were performed in rat livers and serum. A functional network-based regulation model was constructed using Cytoscape with information derived from transcriptomics and metabolomics. The results revealed that 96 genes, 17 liver metabolites and 4 serum metabolites consistently changed in different NAFLD phenotypes (&gt;2-fold, P&lt;0.05). Gene-metabolite network analysis identified ccl2 and jun as hubs with the largest connections to other genes, which were mainly involved in tumor necrosis factor, P53, nuclear factor-kappa B, chemokine, peroxisome proliferator activated receptor and Toll-like receptor signaling pathways. The specifically regulated genes and metabolites in different NAFLD phenotypes constructed their own networks, which were mainly involved in the lipid and fatty acid metabolism in HFD models, the inflammatory and immune response in MCDD models, and the AMPK signaling pathway and response to insulin in HFD+STZ models. Our study identified networks showing the general and specific characteristics in different NAFLD phenotypes, complementing the genetic and metabolic features in NAFLD with hepatic and extra-hepatic manifestations.</abstracttext>]",[]

These diseases represent a serious and widespread health problem in the Western world; however the underlying molecular basis is not clear. ATF3 is an 'immediate early' gene whose expression is highly and transiently induced in response to multiple stressors such as metabolic, oxidative, endoplasmic reticulum and inflammation, stressors that are involved in T2D cardiomyopathy. The role of ATF3 in diabetic cardiomyopathy is currently unknown. Our research has aimed to study the effect of ATF3 expression on cardiomyocytes, heart function and glucose homeostasis in an obesity-induced T2D mouse model.</abstracttext>, <abstracttext label=""METHODS AND RESULTS"" nlmcategory=""RESULTS"">We used wild type mice (WT) as well as mutant mice with a cardiac-specific ATF3 deficiency (ATF3-cKO). Mice were fed a high-fat diet (HFD) for 15¬†weeks. HFD induced high ATF3 expression in cardiomyocytes. Mice were examined for cardiac remodeling processes and the diabetic state was assessed. HFD-fed ATF3-cKO mice exhibited severe cardiac fibrosis, higher levels of heart hypertrophic markers, increased inflammation and worse cardiac function, as compared to WT mice. Interestingly, HFD-fed ATF3-cKO mice display increased hyperglycemia and reduced glucose tolerance, despite higher blood insulin levels, as compared to HFD-fed WT mice. Elevated levels of the cardiac inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and TNFŒ± leading to impaired insulin signalling may partially explain the peripheral glucose intolerance.</abstracttext>, <abstracttext label=""CONCLUSIONS"" nlmcategory=""CONCLUSIONS"">Cardiac ATF3 has a protective role in dampening the HFD-induced cardiac remodeling processes.

The aim of study was to investigate the haplotypes, gene-gene interactions and their role in determining individual susceptibility to T2DM of family members with diabetic history. Haplotype analysis of 2 SNPs each in IL-6 and adiponectin genes showing Pairwise Linkage disequilibrium (LD) was done by SHEsis software. Logistic regression was used to study various combinations of gene-gene interactions. The TCGT* set of allele combination appeared to increase the disease risk upto 2 times while TATG* upto 51.4 times when four SNPs are taken together viz. IL-1Œ≤-511 C/T, IL-18-607 A/C, ADIPOQ1 +45 G/T and ADIPOQ2 +10211 T/G. Interaction of SNPs in eight genes showed one highly significant combination of alleles, TCGAGCTT* which increased the risk of T2DM upto 7.4 times while CAGAGCGT* allele combination increased the risk upto 4 times. During pedigree analysis in six families with four SNPs, it was interesting to note that susceptible 'AC' genotype of IL-18-607 A/C was frequent in diabetic individuals in almost all families. Moreover, when checked for the presence of risk haplotypes it was observed that TCGT* and TATG* sets of allele combinations were present in most of the diabetic individuals. Individuals with certain abnormal biochemical parameters but not yet diagnosed for T2DM carried the risk genotype or haplotype. This suggested that individuals carrying risk genotypes/haplotypes might be susceptible to T2DM and develop the disease in future.</abstracttext>]",[]

The current classification of PH is based on a relatively simple combination of patient characteristics and hemodynamics. This leads to inherent limitations, including the inability to customize treatment and the lack of clarity from a more granular identification based on individual patient phenotypes. Accurate phenotyping of PH can be used in the clinic to select therapies and determine prognosis and in research to increase the homogeneity of study cohorts. Rapid advances in the mechanistic understanding of the disease, improved imaging methods, and innovative biomarkers now provide an opportunity to define novel PH phenotypes. We have recently shown that altered metabolism may affect nitric oxide levels and protein glycosylation, the peripheral circulation (which may provide insights into the response to therapy), and exhaled-breath analysis (which may be useful in disease evaluation). This review is based on a talk presented during the 2015 Grover Conference and highlights the relevant literature describing novel methods to phenotype pulmonary arterial hypertension patients by using approaches that involve the pulmonary and systemic (peripheral) vasculature. In particular, abnormalities in metabolism, the pulmonary and peripheral circulation, and exhaled breath in PH may help identify phenotypes that can be the basis for a precision-medicine approach to PH management. These approaches may also have a broader scope and may contribute to a better understanding of other diseases, such as asthma, diabetes, and cancer.</abstracttext>]","['http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/688847', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmid/28090286/']"

Our previous study has demonstrated that ZiBuPiYin recipe (ZBPYR) possesses excellent pharmacological effects against diabetes-associated cognitive decline. To elucidate the role of ZBPYR in regulating the balance of gut microbiota to improve psychological-stress-induced diabetes-associated cognitive decline (PSDACD), we compared blood glucose, behavioral and cognitive functions and diversity of the bacterial community among experimental groups. The Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF) rats with PSDACD exhibited behavioral and cognitive anomalies showing as increased anxiety- and depression-like behaviors and decreased learning and memory abilities. High-throughput sequencing of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene revealed that Roseburia and Coprococcus were decreased in ZDF rats with PSDACD compared with control group. Notably, these changes were reversed by ZBPYR treatment. Our findings indicate that ZBPYR might prevent PSDACD by maintaining the compositions of gut microbiota, which could be developed as a new therapy for T2D with PSDACD.</abstracttext>]",['http://www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget/misc/linkedout.php?pii=14611']

Structural abnormalities in hippocampal volume and shape are found in several common neuropsychiatric disorders. To identify the genetic underpinnings of hippocampal structure here we perform a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of 33,536 individuals and discover six independent loci significantly associated with hippocampal volume, four of them novel. Of the novel loci, three lie within genes (ASTN2, DPP4 and MAST4) and one is found 200‚Äâkb upstream of SHH. A hippocampal subfield analysis shows that a locus within the MSRB3 gene shows evidence of a localized effect along the dentate gyrus, subiculum, CA1 and fissure. Further, we show that genetic variants associated with decreased hippocampal volume are also associated with increased risk for Alzheimer's disease (r<sub>g</sub>=-0.155).

MODY gene screening would reveal those women genetically predisposed and previously unrecognized with a monogenic form of diabetes for further clinical management, family screening and genetic counselling. However, there are minimal data available on MODY gene variants in pregnant women with diabetes from India. In this study, utilizing the Next generation sequencing (NGS) based protocol fifty subjects were screened for variants in a panel of thirteen MODY genes. Of these subjects 18% (9/50) were positive for definite or likely pathogenic or uncertain MODY variants. The majority of these variants was identified in subjects with autosomal dominant family history, of whom five were in women with pre-GDM and four with overt-GDM. The identified variants included one patient with HNF1A Ser3Cys, two PDX1 Glu224Lys, His94Gln, two NEUROD1 Glu59Gln, Phe318Ser, one INS Gly44Arg, one GCK, one ABCC8 Arg620Cys and one BLK Val418Met variants. In addition, three of the seven offspring screened were positive for the identified variant. These identified variants were further confirmed by Sanger sequencing. In conclusion, these findings in pregnant women with diabetes, imply that a proportion of GDM patients with autosomal dominant family history may have MODY. Further NGS based comprehensive studies with larger samples are required to confirm these finding.</abstracttext>]",['http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0168656']

HSkMC from 10 lean and 10 obese, insulin resistant subjects were treated with excess fatty acid for 24‚Äâh (24hFA) to gauge lipid-related metabolic flexibility. Metabolically inflexible HSkMC from obese individuals were then treated with 24hFA in combination with FENO to determine effectiveness for increasing FAO. Mitochondrial enzyme activity and FAO were measured in skeletal muscle from subjects with prediabetes (n=11) before and after 10 weeks of fenofibrate in vivo. 24hFA increased FAO to a greater extent in HSkMC from lean versus obese subjects (+49% vs. +9%, for lean vs. obese, respectively; p&lt;0.05) indicating metabolic inflexibility with obesity. Metabolic inflexibility was not observed for measures of cellular respiration in permeabilized cells using carbohydrate substrate. Fenofibrate co-incubation with 24hFA, increased FAO in a subset of HSkMC from metabolically inflexible, obese subjects (p&lt;0.05), which was eliminated by PPARŒ± antagonist. In vivo, fenofibrate treatment increased skeletal muscle FAO in a subset of subjects with prediabetes but did not affect gene transcription or mitochondrial enzyme activity. Lipid metabolic inflexibility observed in HSkMC from obese subjects is not due to differences in electron transport flux, but rather upstream decrements in lipid metabolism. Fenofibrate increases the capacity for FAO in human skeletal muscle cells, though its role in skeletal muscle metabolism in vivo remains unclear.</abstracttext>]",[]

Wnt signalling pathway activation leads to repressed adipogenic differentiation while certain microRNAs may regulate pre-adipocyte proliferation and differentiation. We show here that in mouse white adipose tissue, miR-17-5p level is elevated after high fat diet consumption. miR-17-5p upregulates adipogenic differentiation, as its over-expression increased while its inhibition repressed 3T3-L1 differentiation. The Tcf7l2 gene encodes a key Wnt signalling pathway effector, and its human homologue TCF7L2 is a highly regarded diabetes risk gene. We found that Tcf7l2 is an miR-17-5p target and confirmed the repressive effect of Tcf7l2 on 3T3-L1 adipogenic differentiation. The natural plant polyphenol compound curcumin possesses the body weight lowering effect. We observed that curcumin attenuated miR-17-5p expression and stimulated Tcf7l2 expression in 3T3-L1 cells. These, along with the elevation of miR-17-5p expression in mouse epididymal fat tissue in response to high fat diet consumption, allowed us to suggest that miR-17-5p is among central switches of adipogenic differentiation. It activates adipogenesis via repressing the Wnt signalling pathway effector Tcf7l2, and its own expression is likely nutritionally regulated in health and disease.</abstracttext>]",[]

"Aslam AA, Higgins C, Sinha IP, Southern KW.",2017,28102546,Ataluren and similar compounds (specific therapies for premature termination codon class I mutations) for cystic fibrosis.,The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,"[<abstracttext label=""BACKGROUND"" nlmcategory=""BACKGROUND"">Cystic fibrosis is a common life-shortening genetic disorder in the Caucasian population (less common in other ethnic groups) caused by the mutation of a single gene that codes for the production of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator protein. This protein coordinates the transport of salt (and bicarbonate) across cell surfaces and the mutation most notably affects the airways. In the lungs of people with cystic fibrosis, defective protein results in a dehydrated surface liquid and compromised mucociliary clearance. The resulting thick mucus makes the airway prone to chronic infection and inflammation, which consequently damages the structure of the airways, eventually leading to respiratory failure. Additionally, abnormalities in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator protein lead to other systemic complications including malnutrition, diabetes and subfertility.Five classes of mutation have been described, depending on the impact of the mutation on the processing of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator protein in the cell. In class I mutations, the presence of premature termination codons prevents the production of any functional protein resulting in a severe cystic fibrosis phenotype. Advances in the understanding of the molecular genetics of cystic fibrosis has led to the development of novel mutation-specific therapies. Therapies targeting class I mutations (premature termination codons) aim to mask the abnormal gene sequence and enable the normal cellular mechanism to read through the mutation, potentially restoring the production of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator protein. This could in turn make salt transport in the cells function more normally and may decrease the chronic infection and inflammation that characterises lung disease in people with cystic fibrosis.</abstracttext>, <abstracttext label=""OBJECTIVES"" nlmcategory=""OBJECTIVE"">To evaluate the benefits and harms of ataluren and similar compounds on clinically important outcomes in people with cystic fibrosis with class I mutations (premature termination codons).</abstracttext>, <abstracttext label=""SEARCH METHODS"" nlmcategory=""METHODS"">We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register which is compiled from electronic database searches and handsearching of journals and conference abstract books. We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles.

Cross-over trials were reviewed individually to evaluate whether data from the first treatment arm could be included. We excluded trials that combined therapies for premature termination codon class I mutations with other mutation-specific therapies.</abstracttext>, <abstracttext label=""DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS"" nlmcategory=""METHODS"">The authors independently assessed the risk of bias and extracted data from the included trial; they contacted trial authors for additional data.</abstracttext>, <abstracttext label=""MAIN RESULTS"" nlmcategory=""RESULTS"">Our searches identified 28 references to eight trials; five trials were excluded (three were cross-over and one was not randomised and one did not have relevant outcomes), one cross-over trial is awaiting classification pending provision of data and one trial is ongoing. The included parallel randomised controlled trial compared ataluren to placebo for a duration of 48 weeks in 238 participants (age range 6 to 53 years) with cystic fibrosis who had at least one nonsense mutation (a type of class I mutation).The quality of evidence and risk of bias assessments for the trial were moderate overall. Random sequence generation, allocation concealment and blinding of trial personnel were well-documented; participant blinding was less clear. Some participant data were excluded from the analysis. The trial was assessed as high risk of bias for selective outcome reporting, especially when reporting on the trial's post hoc subgroup of participants by chronic inhaled antibiotic use.The trial was sponsored by PTC Therapeutics Incorporated with grant support by the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, the Food and Drug Administration's Office of Orphan Products Development and the National Institutes of Health (NIH).The trial reported no significant difference between treatment groups in quality of life, assessed by the Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire-Revised respiratory domain score and no improvement in respiratory function measures (mean difference of relative change in forced expiratory volume at one second 2.97% (95% confidence interval -0.58 to 6.52)). Ataluren was associated with a significantly higher rate of episodes of renal impairment, risk ratio 17.70 (99% confidence interval 1.28 to 244.40). The trial reported no significant treatment effect for ataluren for the review's secondary outcomes: pulmonary exacerbation; computerised tomography score; weight; body mass index; and sweat chloride. No deaths were reported in the trial.A post hoc subgroup analysis of participants not receiving chronic inhaled tobramycin (n = 146) demonstrated favourable results for ataluren (n = 72) for relative change in % predicted forced expiratory volume at one second and pulmonary exacerbation rate. Participants receiving chronic inhaled tobramycin appeared to have a reduced rate of pulmonary exacerbation compared to those not receiving chronic inhaled tobramycin. This drug interaction was not anticipated and may affect the interpretation of the trial results.</abstracttext>, <abstracttext label=""AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS"" nlmcategory=""CONCLUSIONS"">There is currently insufficient evidence to determine the effect of ataluren as a therapy for people with cystic fibrosis with class I mutations. Future trials should carefully assess for adverse events, notably renal impairment and consider the possibility of drug interactions. Cross-over trials should be avoided given the potential for the treatment to change the natural history of cystic fibrosis.</abstracttext>]",[]

The present study aimed to analyze G6pc, Fbp1, and Pck1 gene expressions in two experimental animal models of impaired glucose metabolism. We also evaluated hepatic and renal tissue integrity following CŒ≥ treatment. To generate an insulin resistance model, male Wistar rats were provided 30% sucrose solution ad libitum for 20 weeks. To generate a type 2 diabetes model (STZ), five-day-old rats were intraperitoneally injected with streptozotocin (150¬†mg/kg). Each animal model was randomized into three subgroups that received the following oral treatments daily for one week: 0.9% w/v NaCl (vehicle; IR-Ctrl and STZ-Ctrl); metformin 300¬†mg/kg (IR-Met and STZ-Met); and CŒ≥ 150¬†mg/kg (IR-CŒ≥ and STZ-CŒ≥). Biochemical parameters were assessed pre- and post-treatment using colorimetric or enzymatic methods. We also performed histological analysis of hepatic and renal tissue. G6pc, Fbp1, and Pck1 gene expressions were quantified using real-time PCR. No histological changes were observed in any group. Post-treatment G6pc gene expression was decreased in the IR-CŒ≥ and STZ-CŒ≥ groups. Post-treatment Fbp1 and Pck1 gene expressions were reduced in the IR-CŒ≥ group but increased in STZ-CŒ≥ animals. Overall, these findings suggest that CŒ≥ is involved in reducing hepatic glucose production, mainly through G6pc inhibition in impaired glucose metabolism disorders.</abstracttext>]",[]

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small noncoding RNAs molecules that negatively regulate gene expression by inducing target mRNA cleavage or by inhibiting protein translation. Abnormal miRNA expressions have been described in autoimmune diseases and T1DM. Polymorphisms in genes codifying miRNAs may alter the expression of the corresponding miRNA and, thus, confer susceptibility for a given disease.

Despite advances in treatment of diabetes mellitus, currently, medications available are unable to control the progression of diabetes and its complications. Growing evidence suggests that inflammation is an important pathogenic mediator in the development of diabetes mellitus. The perspectives including suggestions for new therapies involving the shift from metabolic stress to inflammation should be taken into account. <i>Critical Issues.</i> High-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), a nonhistone nuclear protein regulating gene expression, was rediscovered as an endogenous danger signal molecule to trigger inflammatory responses when released into extracellular milieu in the late 1990s. Given the similarities of inflammatory response in the development of T2D, we will discuss the potential implication of HMGB1 in the pathogenesis of T2D. Importantly, we will summarize and renovate the role of HMGB1 and HMGB1-mediated inflammatory pathways in adipose tissue inflammation, insulin resistance, and islet dysfunction. <i>Future Directions.</i> HMGB1 and its downstream receptors RAGE and TLRs may serve as potential antidiabetic targets. Current and forthcoming projects in this territory will pave the way for prospective approaches targeting the center of HMGB1-mediated inflammation to improve T2D and its complications.</abstracttext>]",[]

At present, transdifferentiation among mature cells is achieved mainly by introducing foreign genes into the starting tissue with viral vector, but there are potentical safety problems. In the present study, we delivered plasmids carrying Pdx1, Neurog3 and MafA genes (PNM) into mouse hepatocytes by hydrodynamics tail vein injection, investigated islet Œ≤ cells markers in transfected cells from protein and mRNA level, and then observed the long-term control of blood glucose in diabetic mice. We found that hepatocytes could be directly reprogrammed into insulin-producing cells after PNM gene transfection by non-viral hydrodynamics injection, and fasting blood glucose was reduced to normal, and lasted until 100 days after transfection. Intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test (IPGTT) showed that glucose regulation ability was improved gradually and the serum insulin level approached to the level of normal mice with time. Insulin-positive cells were found in the liver tissue, and the expression of various islet Œ≤-cell-specific genes were detected at the mRNA level, including islet mature marker gene Ucn3.

In Europe, the morbidity and mortality caused by cardiovascular disease are the highest among all diseases. Therefore, it seems important to search for new and alternative therapies for obesity, which is the main cause of type 2 diabetes (T2D) and cardiovascular disease (CD). Great attention has been paid to the role of brown adipose tissue in fat burning and the possibility of transformation of the white adipose tissue to cells with brown adipose tissue function as a potential form of treatment of obesity. The best-characterized marker of brown adipose tissue is uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1), which has the ability to dissipate energy as heat in the process called non-shivering thermogenesis. Numerous studies have shown that altered expression of this protein can lead to disturbances in fat metabolism. One possible reason for the aberrant expression of UCP1 may be inherited variations in the gene encoding that protein.

Activation of the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) and its ligands has been suggested to participate in chronic disorders such as diabetes and its complications. In this study, the expression of RAGE, high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) and advanced glycation end products (AGE), as well as the effects of low-power laser irradiation (LPLI) in salivary glands of diabetic rats were evaluated, and the mechanisms involved were characterized. The expression of RAGE and HMGB1 at the protein and mRNA levels was observed in submandibular glands (SMGs) of streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats. A diode laser was applied at 660 nm, 70 mW, 20 J/cm2, 0.56 J/point, with a spot area of 0.028 cm2 and its in vivo effects and the pathways involved were evaluated. Immunohistochemistry and western blotting analysis were performed for inflammatory and apoptosis markers. Diabetes up-regulates HMGB1/AGE/RAGE axis gene expression in SMGs that is associated with activation of the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-Œ∫B) pathway. Interestingly, LPLI suppresses NF-Œ∫B activation induced by inflammation. LPLI also reduces diabetes-induced apoptosis. That effect was accompanied by decreased levels of Bax, and cleaved caspase 3, which were up-regulated in diabetes. Taken together, our data suggest that LPLI reduces diabetes-induced inflammation by reducing the induction of HMGB1, ultimately leading to inhibition of apoptosis in submandibular glands of diabetic rats.</abstracttext>]",['http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0169443']

The protective mechanism of ASP remains unknown. However, as one of possible, it is well known that phytochemical flavonoids reduce oxidative stress via nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2) activation resulting in up-regulation of antioxidant genes and enzymes. Therefore, we hypothesized that ASP protects the myocardium against HG- and hyperglycemia-induced oxidative damage by up-regulating <i>Nrf2</i> expression in H9c2 cardiomyocytes and diabetic (<i>db</i>/<i>db</i>) mice, respectively. Using an oxidative stress RT¬≤ Profiler PCR array, ASP at a dose of 1 ¬µM was demonstrated to protect H9c2 cardiomyocytes against HG-induced oxidative stress, but silencing of <i>Nrf2</i> abolished this protective response of ASP and exacerbated cardiomyocyte apoptosis. <i>Db</i>/<i>db</i> mice and their non-diabetic (<i>db</i>/<i>+</i>) littermate controls were subsequently treated daily for six weeks with either a low (13 mg/kg) or high (130 mg/kg) ASP dose. Compared to nondiabetic mice the <i>db</i>/<i>db</i> mice presented increased cardiac remodeling and enlarged left ventricular wall that occurred concomitant to enhanced oxidative stress. Daily treatment of mice with ASP at a dose of 130 mg/kg for six weeks was more effective at reversing complications than both a low dose ASP or metformin, eliciting enhanced expression of <i>Nrf2</i> and its downstream antioxidant genes. These results indicate that ASP maintains cellular homeostasis and protects the myocardium against hyperglycemia-induced oxidative stress through activation of <i>Nrf2</i> and its downstream target genes.</abstracttext>]",['http://www.mdpi.com/resolver?pii=molecules22010129']

Concern about bone health in obese children, in part, derives from the potentially increased fracture risk associated with obesity. Additional risk factors that affect bone mineral accretion, may also contribute to obesity, such as low physical activity and nutritional factors. Consequences of obesity, such as inflammation, insulin resistance, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, may also affect bone mineral acquisition, especially during the adolescent years when rapid increases in bone contribute to attaining peak bone mass. Further, numerous pediatric health conditions are associated with excess adiposity, altered body composition, or endocrine disturbances that can affect bone accretion. Thus, there is a multitude of reasons for considering clinical assessment of bone health in an obese child. Multiple diagnostic challenges affect the measurement of bone density and its interpretation. These include greater precision error, difficulty in positioning, and the effects of increased lean and fat tissue on bone health outcomes. Future research is required to address these issues to improve bone health assessment in obese children.</abstracttext>]",[]

In our recent article we have used 16S rRNA gene targeted high-throughput sequencing to comprehensively characterise the mucosal microbiota in healthy siblings of CD patients, and determine the influence of genotypic and phenotypic factors on the gut microbiota (dysbiosis). We have demonstrated that the core microbiota of both patients with CD and healthy siblings is significantly less diverse than controls. Faecalibacterium prausnitzii contributed most to core metacommunity dissimilarity between both patients and controls and between siblings and controls. Phenotype/genotype markers of CD risk significantly influenced microbiota variation between and within groups, of which genotype had the largest effect.

Viral persistence has been reported as a key mechanism in the pathogenesis of CVB-associated chronic diseases such as type 1 diabetes (T1D). The impact of CVB4 persistence on human pancreas ductal-like cells was investigated. Methods A persistent CVB4 infection was established in ductal-like cells. PDX-1 expression, resistance to CVB4-induced lysis and CAR expression were evaluated. The profile of cellular microRNAs (miRNAs) was investigated through miRNA-sequencing. Viral phenotypic changes were examined, and genomic modifications were assessed by sequencing of the viral genome. Results The CVB4 persistence in ductal-like cells was productive, with continuous release of infectious particles.Persistently infected cells displayed a resistance to CVB4-induced lysis upon superinfection and expression of PDX-1 and CAR was decreased. These changes were maintained even after virus clearance. The patterns of cellular miRNA expression in mock-infected and in CVB4-persistently infected ductal-like cells were clearly different. The persistent infection-derived virus (PIDV) was still able to induce cytopathic effect but its plaques were smaller than the parental virus. Several mutations appeared in various PIDV genome regions, but amino acid substitutions did not affect the predicted site of interaction with CAR. Conclusion Cellular and viral changes occur during persistent infection of human pancreas ductal-like cells with CVB4. The persistence of cellular changes even after virus clearance supports the hypothesis of a long-lasting impact of persistent CVB infection on the cells.</abstracttext>]",[]

Villous trophoblast may be a major source of these factors. It forms the classical placental barrier between mother and fetus, and is thus exposed to maternal influences as well. Metabolic and hormonal derangements in gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) affect feto-placental angiogenesis and vascular growth. Here we hypothesized that GDM alters the trophoblast secretome, which will modulate the paracrine regulation of feto-placental angiogenesis. Primary term trophoblasts were isolated from normal (n=6) and GDM (n=6) pregnancies. Trophoblast conditioned medium (CM) was used to investigate paracrine effects of normal and GDM-exposed trophoblasts on feto-placental endothelial cells (fpECs; n=7), using functional assays for 2D network formation, wound healing, chemotaxis, and proliferation. Gene expression of 23 pro- and anti-angiogenic factors was analyzed. Four trophoblast-derived paracrine regulators of angiogenesis were specifically measured in CM. CM from GDM trophoblasts increased 2D network formation of fpEC by 2.4-fold (P&lt;0.001), whereas wound healing was attenuated by 1.8-fold (P=0.02) and chemo-attraction to the CM was reduced by 33¬±9% (P=0.02). The effect of CM on proliferation was unchanged between normal and GDM trophoblasts. Expression analysis of pro- and anti-angiogenic molecules in normal and GDM trophoblasts revealed significant differences in ANGPT2, HGF, KISS1 and PLGF expression. Analysis of secreted proteins demonstrated reduced pigment epithelium derived factor and tumor necrosis factor-Œ± secretion by GDM trophoblasts.

Polyunsaturated fatty acid species were moderately increased in the examined tissues of ob/ob mice, since they can only be absorbed from diets or elongated from the ingested n-3 or n-6 FA. Different profiles of FA chains between ob/ob mouse liver and skeletal muscle reflect diverging lipogenesis pathways in these organs. Amounts of vaccenic acids (i.e., 18:1(n-7) FA) in 12- and 16-week ob/ob mouse liver were significantly increased compared to their controls, indicating enhanced de novo synthesis of this acid through 16:1(n-7) FA in the liver starting at 12 weeks of age. Coincidentally, synthesis of triacylglycerol from monoacylglycerol in the liver was also increased in ob/ob mice starting at 12 weeks of age, as revealed by simulation of triacylglycerol synthesis. Moreover, levels of lipotoxic lipid classes were significantly higher in ob/ob mice than their age-matched controls, supporting the notion that elevated lipotoxic components are tightly associated with insulin resistance in ob/ob mice.

Uncoupling protein 1 (Ucp1) is the functional marker of both brown and beige adipocytes. To facilitate a reliable, easy, and sensitive measurement of Ucp1 expression both in vivo and in vitro, we generated a Ucp1-2A-luciferase knock-in mouse by deleting the stop codon for the mouse Ucp1 gene and replacing it with a 2A peptide. This peptide was followed by the luciferase coding sequence to recapitulate the expression of the Ucp1 gene at the transcriptional and translational levels. With this mouse, we discovered a cold-sensitive brown/beige adipose depot underneath the skin of the ears, which we named uBAT. Because of the sensitivity and high dynamic range of luciferase activity, the Ucp1-2A-luciferase mouse is useful for both in vitro quantitative determination and in vivo visualization of nonshivering thermogenesis.

To understand the mechanisms by which meta-inflammation resolves during WL, we examined adipose tissue leukocytes in mice after withdrawal of a high-fat diet. After 8 weeks of WL, mice achieved similar weights and glucose tolerance values as age-matched lean controls but showed abnormal insulin tolerance. Despite fat mass normalization, total and CD11c<sup>+</sup> adipose tissue macrophage (ATM) content remained elevated in WL mice for up to 6 months and was associated with persistent fibrosis in adipose tissue. ATMs in formerly obese mice demonstrated a proinflammatory profile, including elevated expression of interferon-Œ≥, tumor necrosis factor-Œ±, and interleukin-1Œ≤. T-cell-deficient Rag1<sup>-/-</sup> mice showed a degree of ATM persistence similar to that in WT mice, but with reduced inflammatory gene expression. ATM proliferation was identified as the predominant mechanism by which ATMs are retained in adipose tissue with WL.

Although PARylation has been studied extensively, few examples of definitive biological roles for site-specific PARylation have been reported. Here we show that C/EBPŒ≤, a key pro-adipogenic transcription factor, is PARylated by PARP-1 on three amino acids in a conserved regulatory domain. PARylation at these sites inhibits C/EBPŒ≤'s DNA binding and transcriptional activities and attenuates adipogenesis in various genetic and cell-based models. Interestingly, PARP-1 catalytic activity drops precipitously during the first 48¬†hr of differentiation, corresponding to a¬†release of C/EBPŒ≤ from PARylation-mediated inhibition. This promotes the binding of C/EBPŒ≤ at enhancers controlling the expression of adipogenic target genes and continued differentiation. Depletion or chemical inhibition of PARP-1, or mutation of the PARylation sites on C/EBPŒ≤, enhances these early adipogenic events.

Here we tested the activity of the small-molecule synthetic TLR4 antagonist, FP7, in vitro on human monocytes and monocyte-derived dendritic cells (DCs) and in vivo during influenza virus infection of mice. Our results indicate that FP7 antagonized the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-8, and MIP-1Œ≤) by monocytes and DCs (IC<sub>50</sub>‚Äâ&lt;‚Äâ1‚ÄâŒºM) and prevented DC maturation upon TLR4 activation by ultrapure lipopolysaccharide (LPS).

FP7 protected mice from influenza virus-induced lethality and reduced both proinflammatory cytokine gene expression in the lungs and acute lung injury (ALI).

Here we show that Atf5, a close but less-studied relative of Atf4, is also a target of Pdx1 and is critical for Œ≤-cell survival under stress conditions. Pdx1 deficiency led to decreased Atf5 transcript, and primary islet ChIP-sequencing localized PDX1 to the Atf5 promoter, implicating Atf5 as a PDX1 target. Atf5 expression was stress inducible and enriched in Œ≤ cells. Importantly, Atf5 deficiency decreased survival under stress conditions. Loss-of-function and chromatin occupancy experiments positioned Atf5 downstream of and parallel to Atf4 in the regulation of eIF4E-binding protein 1 (4ebp1), a mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway component that inhibits protein translation.

Specifically, transcriptional profiles of feed arteries and second branch order arterioles in the soleus, gastrocnemius, and diaphragm muscles as well as aortic endothelial scrapes were examined from obese insulin-resistant Otsuka Long-Evans Tokushima Fatty rats treated with ( n‚Äâ=‚Äâ9) or without ( n‚Äâ=‚Äâ10) metformin from 20 to 32 weeks of age. Metformin-treated rats exhibited a reduction in body weight, adiposity, and HbA1c ( P‚Äâ&lt;‚Äâ0.05). The greatest number of differentially expressed genes (FDR‚Äâ&lt;‚Äâ15%) between those treated with and without metformin was found in the red gastrocnemius 2a arterioles (93 genes), followed by the diaphragm 2a arterioles (62 genes), and soleus 2a arterioles (15 genes).

No single gene was altered by metformin across all vessels examined. This study provides evidence that metformin treatment produces distinct gene expression effects throughout the arterial tree in a rat model of obesity and insulin resistance. Genes whose expression was modulated with metformin do not appear to have a clear connection with its known mechanisms of action. These findings support the notion that vascular gene regulation in response to oral pharmacological therapy, such as metformin, is vessel specific.</abstracttext>]",['http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1535370216689825?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&rfr_dat=cr_pub%3dpubmed']

Although previous efforts were successful for individual disease conditions (single disease), limited information exists on shared genetic risk between these disorders. This article presents a detailed review and analysis of cardiometabolic diseases risk (CMD-R) genes that are also associated with mood disorders. First, we reviewed meta-GWASs published until January 2016, for the diseases 'type 2 diabetes, coronary artery disease, hypertension' and/or for the risk factors 'blood pressure, obesity, plasma lipid levels, insulin and glucose related traits'. We then searched the literature for published associations of these CMD-R genes with mood disorders. We considered studies that reported a significant association of at least one of the CMD-R genes and 'depression' or 'depressive disorder' or 'depressive symptoms' or 'bipolar disorder' or 'lithium treatment response in bipolar disorder', or 'serotonin reuptake inhibitors treatment response in major depression'. Our review revealed 24 potential pleiotropic genes that are likely to be shared between mood disorders and CMD-Rs. These genes include MTHFR, CACNA1D, CACNB2, GNAS, ADRB1, NCAN, REST, FTO, POMC, BDNF, CREB, ITIH4, LEP, GSK3B, SLC18A1, TLR4, PPP1R1B, APOE, CRY2, HTR1A, ADRA2A, TCF7L2, MTNR1B and IGF1. A pathway analysis of these genes revealed significant pathways: corticotrophin-releasing hormone signaling, AMPK signaling, cAMP-mediated or G-protein coupled receptor signaling, axonal guidance signaling, serotonin or dopamine receptors signaling, dopamine-DARPP32 feedback in cAMP signaling, circadian rhythm signaling and leptin signaling.

We searched curated datasets of the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database and identified 13 and five expression studies of diabetes and insulin responses at various tissues, respectively. We tested differential gene expression by empirical Bayes-based linear method and investigated gene set expression association by knowledge-based enrichment analysis. Meta-analysis by different methods was applied to identify tissue non-specific genes and gene sets. We also proposed pathway mapping analysis to infer functions of the identified gene sets, and correlation and independent analysis to evaluate expression association profile of genes and gene sets between studies and tissues. Our analysis showed that <i>PGRMC1</i> and <i>HADH</i> genes were significant over diabetes studies, while <i>IRS1</i> and <i>MPST</i> genes were significant over insulin response studies, and joint analysis showed that HADH and MPST genes were significant over all combined data sets. The pathway analysis identified six significant gene sets over all studies. The KEGG pathway mapping indicated that the significant gene sets are related to diabetes pathogenesis. The results also presented that 12.8% and 59.0% pairwise studies had significantly correlated expression association for genes and gene sets, respectively; moreover, 12.8% pairwise studies had independent expression association for genes, but no studies were observed significantly different for expression association of gene sets. Our analysis indicated that there are both tissue specific and non-specific genes and pathways associated with diabetes pathogenesis. Compared to the gene expression, pathway association tends to be tissue non-specific, and a common pathway influencing diabetes development is activated through different genes at different tissues.</abstracttext>]",['http://www.mdpi.com/resolver?pii=genes8010044']

However, pre-clinical data also demonstrate that islet-specific Tregs are more potent than polyclonal Tregs at reversing T1D. Translation of this approach into man will require methods to generate large populations of islet-specific Tregs which, to date, has proved to be a major hurdle. Here we demonstrate the feasibility of lentiviral-mediated T cell receptor (TCR) gene transfer to confer antigen specificity on polyclonal human Tregs. Targeting has been achieved using TCRs isolated from human islet-specific and viral-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell clones. Engineered T cells demonstrated expression of ectopically-delivered TCRs, resulting in endowment of cognate antigen-specific responses. This enabled antigen-specific suppression at increased potency compared to polyclonal Tregs. However, cells transduced with islet-specific TCRs were less responsive to cognate antigen than viral-specific TCRs, and in some cases, required additional methods to isolate functional antigen-specific Tregs. This study demonstrates the potential of TCR gene transfer to develop islet-specific Treg therapies for effective treatment of T1D, but also highlights that additional optimisation may be required to achieve its full potential.</abstracttext>]",['https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0896-8411(17)30018-5']

Genetic and non-genetic factors influencing its plasma levels.,Current medicinal chemistry,"[<abstracttext>The limited distribution of lipoprotein (a) (Lp(a)) to humans, Old World primates and to the European hedgehog, has raised considerable interest and speculation regarding its possible physiological role. Lp(a) has variable circulating concentrations (&amp;lt;0.1 - &amp;gt;100 mg/ml) which are highly genetically determined in humans. These characteristics gave rise to several theories concerning the origins and evolution of Lp(a). Lp(a) has a protective role after injury since Lp(a) particles bind to macrophages and platelets membrane receptors, leading to fibrin activation and injury healing. On the other hand, Lp(a) seems to be implicated in the formation of atheromatic plaques but also in cerebrovascular events and stenosis of the aortic valve. The main genetic factor determining plasma Lp(a) levels is the Lp(a) gene (LPA). Most Caucasian people have normal plasma Lp(a) concentrations, but there is important distribution variation according to race. Women seem to have increased Lp(a) levels compared with men, while diabetes mellitus type 2 favours lower plasma Lp(a) levels.

While precision diabetes medicine is often framed in the context of pharmacotherapy, using biomarkers to personalise lifestyle recommendations, intended to lower type 2 diabetes risk or to slow progression, is also conceivable. There are at least four ways in which this might work: (1) by helping to predict a person's susceptibility to adverse lifestyle exposures; (2) by facilitating the stratification of type 2 diabetes into subclasses, some of which may be prevented or treated optimally with specific lifestyle interventions; (3) by aiding the discovery of prognostic biomarkers that help guide timing and intensity of lifestyle interventions; (4) by predicting treatment response. In this review we overview the rationale for precision diabetes medicine, specifically as it relates to lifestyle; we also scrutinise existing evidence, discuss the barriers germane to research in this field and consider how this work is likely to proceed.</abstracttext>]",['https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00125-017-4207-5']

Interestingly, much of the oxLDL in circulation is complexed to Abs, and these resulting immune complexes (ICs) are a prominent feature of chronic inflammatory disease, such as atherosclerosis, type-2 diabetes, systemic lupus erythematosus, and rheumatoid arthritis. Levels of oxLDL ICs often correlate with disease severity, and studies demonstrated that oxLDL ICs elicit potent inflammatory responses in macrophages. In this article, we show that bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) incubated with oxLDL ICs for 24 h secrete significantly more IL-1Œ≤ compared with BMDCs treated with free oxLDL, whereas there was no difference in levels of TNF-Œ± or IL-6. Treatment of BMDCs with oxLDL ICs increased expression of inflammasome-related genes Il1a, Il1b, and Nlrp3, and pretreatment with a caspase 1 inhibitor decreased IL-1Œ≤ secretion in response to oxLDL ICs. This inflammasome priming was due to oxLDL IC signaling via multiple receptors, because inhibition of CD36, TLR4, and FcŒ≥R significantly decreased IL-1Œ≤ secretion in response to oxLDL ICs. Signaling through these receptors converged on the adaptor protein CARD9, a component of the CARD9-Bcl10-MALT1 signalosome complex involved in NF-Œ∫B translocation. Finally, oxLDL IC-mediated IL-1Œ≤ production resulted in increased Th17 polarization and cytokine secretion. Collectively, these data demonstrate that oxLDL ICs induce inflammasome activation through a separate and more robust mechanism than oxLDL alone and that these ICs may be immunomodulatory in chronic disease and not just biomarkers of severity.</abstracttext>]",['http://www.jimmunol.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=28130494']

The pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases is extremely complex and remains largely unknown. Recent advances indicate that environmental factors trigger autoimmune diseases in genetically predisposed individuals. In addition, accumulating results have indicated a potential role of epigenetic mechanisms, such as histone modifications, in the development of autoimmune diseases. Histone modifications regulate the chromatin states and gene transcription without any change in the DNA sequence, possibly resulting in phenotype alteration in several different cell types.

The role of LPL in the liver has been controversial but recent studies in mice with liver LPL overexpression or deficiency have revealed important new roles of the enzyme in glucose and lipid metabolism. The objective of this study was to identify regulatory elements and factors that control the transcription of the human LPL gene in hepatocytes. Deletion analysis of the human LPL promoter revealed that the proximal region which harbors a binding site for the forkhead box transcription factor FOXA2/HNF-3Œ≤ at position -47/-40 is important for its hepatic cell activity. Silencing of FOXA2 in HepG2 cells reduced the LPL mRNA and protein levels. Direct binding of FOXA2 to the novel binding site was established in vitro and ex vivo. Mutagenesis of the FOXA2 site reduced the basal activity and abolished the FOXA2-mediated transactivation of the LPL promoter.

In summary, the data of the present study combined with previous findings on the role of FOXA2 in HDL metabolism and gluconeogenesis, suggest that FOXA2 is a key regulator of lipid and glucose homeostasis in the adult liver. Understanding the mechanisms by which FOXA2 exerts its functions in hepatocytes may open the way to novel therapeutic strategies for patients with metabolic diseases such as dyslipidemia, diabetes and the metabolic syndrome.</abstracttext>]",['https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1874-9399(16)30258-9']

A significant correlation was observed between TT genotype of <i>TCF7L2</i> gene and increased risk of GDM (OR 5.4 [95% CI 1.5-19.3]). Moreover, a significant correlation was observed between lipid parameters and genetic variations in additional genes, namely, <i>PPARG2</i> [<i>p</i> = 0,02], <i>APOA5</i> [<i>p</i> = 0,02], <i>MC4R</i> [<i>p</i> = 0,03], <i>LDLR</i> [<i>p</i> = 0,01], and <i>FTO</i> [<i>p</i> = 0,02]. Our findings support the association between <i>TCF7L2</i> rs7903146 variant and an increased GDM risk.

A major contributor to the pathology is excess production of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), a growth factor that induces formation of new blood vessels and increases permeability of existing vessels. Despite the recent availability of effective treatments for the disease, including laser photocoagulation and therapeutic VEGF antibodies, DR remains a significant cause of vision loss worldwide. Existing anti-VEGF agents, though generally effective, are limited by their short therapeutic half-lives, necessitating frequent intravitreal injections and the risk of attendant adverse events. Management of DR with gene therapies has been proposed for several years, and pre-clinical studies have yielded enticing findings. Gene therapy holds several advantages over conventional treatments for DR, such as a longer duration of therapeutic effect, simpler administration, the ability to intervene at an earlier stage of the disease, and potentially fewer side-effects. In this review, we summarize current understanding of the pathophysiology of DR and provide an overview of research into DR gene therapies. We examine current barriers to the clinical application of gene therapy for DR and evaluate future prospects for this approach.</abstracttext>]",[]

However, its role and underlying mechanisms in zebrafish remain largely unknown. To elucidate the function of akt2 in zebrafish, we generated zebrafish lacking akt2 gene via CRISPR/Cas9 technology. Akt2-null zebrafish exhibit partial lethality and severe growth deficiency, which is different from those observed in akt2-null mice. Furthermore, akt2-null zebrafish display deficiency in fin ray development, but their cartilage is not affected. Similar to observations in akt2-null mice, akt2-null zebrafish display impaired glucose homeostasis. However, in contrast to that in akt2-null mice, insulin level is lower in akt2-null zebrafish, implicating the symptoms of type I diabetes exhibited in akt2-null zebrafish. In addition, transcriptome analysis reveals that the genes involved in metabolism and osteogenesis are disturbed in akt2-null zebrafish. Taken together, these data not only support an important role of akt2 in zebrafish survival, growth, bone development and glucose homeostasis, but also suggest that akt2 has divergent functions between mice and zebrafish, even though they are evolutionarily conserved.</abstracttext>]",[]

The risk alleles impair glucose-induced insulin secretion and, paradoxically but characteristically, are associated with decreased proinsulin:insulin ratios, indicating improved proinsulin conversion. Neither the identity of the causal variants nor the gene(s) through which risk is conferred have been firmly established. Whereas ARAP1 encodes a GTPase activating protein, STARD10 is a member of the steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR)-related lipid transfer protein family. By integrating genetic fine-mapping and epigenomic annotation data and performing promoter-reporter and chromatin conformational capture (3C) studies in Œ≤ cell lines, we localize the causal variant(s) at this locus to a 5 kb region that overlaps a stretch-enhancer active in islets. This region contains several highly correlated T2D-risk variants, including the rs140130268 indel. Expression QTL analysis of islet transcriptomes from three independent subject groups demonstrated that T2D-risk allele carriers displayed reduced levels of STARD10 mRNA, with no concomitant change in ARAP1 mRNA levels. Correspondingly, Œ≤-cell-selective deletion of StarD10 in mice led to impaired glucose-stimulated Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics and insulin secretion and recapitulated the pattern of improved proinsulin processing observed at the human GWAS signal. Conversely, overexpression of StarD10 in the adult Œ≤ cell improved glucose tolerance in high fat-fed animals. In contrast, manipulation of Arap1 in Œ≤ cells had no impact on insulin secretion or proinsulin conversion in mice. This convergence of human and murine data provides compelling evidence that the T2D risk associated with variation at this locus is mediated through reduction in STARD10 expression in the Œ≤ cell.</abstracttext>]",[]

In this report, we found a marked increase in the number of apoptotic cardiomyocytes in response to high glucose (HG) treatment. Moreover, up-regulation of ROCK1 expression observed in diabetic offspring compared with controls was potentially associated with cardiomyocyte apoptosis and the ventricular wall thinness. Further investigation showed that p53 and NOXA protein levels increased during ROCK1-meidated apoptosis in response to HG. In response to HG, whereby ROCK1 phosphorylated p53 at Ser15 to up-regulate its protein level. Furthermore, we found that p53 mediated the expression of NOXA during HG-induced apoptosis, and histone acetyltransferase p300 participated in this process.

Members of all 3 sub-families of crystallins, alpha-, beta- and gamma-crystallins have been reported in the retina during diabetes, traumatic injury and other retinal diseases. While their specific role in the retina is still unclear and may vary, beta-crystallin proteins have been shown to play a critical role in ganglion cell survival following trauma. We recently reported the correlation between a gene conversion in the betaB2-crystallin gene and a phenotype of familial congenital cataract. Interestingly, in half of the patients, this phenotype was associated with glaucoma. Taken together, these data suggested that the mutations we recently reported could have an impact on the role of betaB2-crystallin in both lens epithelial cells and retinal neurons. Consistent with this hypothesis, we show in the current study that the gene conversion leading to an amino acid conversion lead to a loss of solubility and a change of subcellular localization of betaB2-crystallin in both cell types. While the overall observations were similar in both cell types, there were some important nuances between them, suggesting different roles and regulation of betaB2-crystallin in lens cells versus retinal neurons. The data reported in this study strongly support a significant role of betaB2-crystallin in both lenticular and retinal ocular tissues and warrant further analysis of its regulation and its impact not only in cataract formation but also in retinal neurodegenerative diseases.</abstracttext>]",[]

Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have roles in the development of many diseases including DN. However, the relationship between lncRNAs and inflammation in DN remains largely unknown. Our previous study has revealed that 14 lncRNAs are abnormally expressed in DN by RNA sequencing and real-time quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR) in the renal tissues of db/db DN mice. In this study, these lncRNAs were verified their expressions by qRT-PCR in mesangial cells (MCs) cultured under high- and low-glucose conditions. Twelve lncRNAs displayed the same expressional tendencies in both renal tissues and MCs. In particular, long intergenic noncoding RNA (lincRNA)-Gm4419 was the only one associating with NF-Œ∫B among these 12 lncRNAs by bioinformatics methods. Moreover, Gm4419 knockdown could obviously inhibit the expressions of pro-inflammatory cytokines and renal fibrosis biomarkers, and reduce cell proliferation in MCs under high-glucose condition, whereas overexpression of Gm4419 could increase the inflammation, fibrosis and cell proliferation in MCs under low-glucose condition. Interestingly, our results showed that Gm4419 could activate the NF-Œ∫B pathway by directly interacting with p50, the subunit of NF-Œ∫B.

An important primer for metaflammation is the persistent metabolic overloading of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), leading to its functional impairment. Activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR), a homeostatic regulatory network that responds to ER stress, is a hallmark of all stages of atherosclerotic plaque formation. The most conserved ER-resident UPR regulator, the kinase/endoribonuclease inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1), is activated in lipid-laden macrophages that infiltrate the atherosclerotic lesions. Using RNA sequencing in macrophages, we discovered that IRE1 regulates the expression of many proatherogenic genes, including several important cytokines and chemokines. We show that IRE1 inhibitors uncouple lipid-induced ER stress from inflammasome activation in both mouse and human macrophages. In vivo, these IRE1 inhibitors led to a significant decrease in hyperlipidemia-induced IL-1Œ≤ and IL-18 production, lowered T-helper type-1 immune responses, and reduced atherosclerotic plaque size without altering the plasma lipid profiles in apolipoprotein E-deficient mice.

To investigate this hypothesis, we used our mouse model of diabetic complications. Mice on a high-fat diet developed hypercholesterolemia, and exposure to streptozotocin rendered hypercholesterolemic mice diabetic. Immunohistochemical images show increased macrophage infiltration and BIGH3 protein in the kidney cortices of hypercholesterolemic and diabetic mice.

Mulder H.,2017,28303303,"Melatonin signalling and type 2 diabetes risk: too little, too much or just right?",Diabetologia,"[<abstracttext>Of the associations of genetic variants with type 2 diabetes, the one of an SNP in an intron of the gene encoding the melatonin receptor 1B (MTNR1B) has been remarkably robust. Work from our group and others has provided support for a model where carriers of this risk G allele exhibit increased MTNR1B expression in islets of Langerhans. Most published studies to date favour that melatonin's action on the beta cell is inhibition of insulin secretion. Hence, our model proposes that this inhibitory effect of melatonin is exaggerated in carriers of the MTNR1B risk G allele. This would explain why this genetic association causes reduced insulin secretion and greater risk of future type 2 diabetes, as has been observed in numerous studies. Concurrently, another body of work has shown that rare MTNR1B alleles, which could perturb receptor function, also associate with type 2 diabetes. In this commentary, it is suggested that such apparently conflicting observations can be reconciled by the fact that non-coding (intronic; frequent) and coding (exonic; rare) alleles of MTNR1B give rise to different phenotypes. Thus, altered gene transcription may explain why SNPs, which do not alter coding sequences, exhibit cell-specific effects. In contrast, SNPs that change protein sequences are more likely to exert generalised effects since an altered protein will appear in all cells expressing the gene.</abstracttext>]",[]

No common genetic variants were found. Fermentable carbohydrates (sugars and starches) were the most relevant common dietary risk factor for both diseases, but associated mechanisms differed. In caries, the fermentation process leads to acid production and the generation of biofilm components such as Glucans. In periodontitis, glycaemia drives oxidative stress and advanced glycation end-products may also trigger a hyper inflammatory state. Micronutrient deficiencies, such as for vitamin C, vitamin D or vitamin B12, may be related to the onset and progression of both diseases. Functional foods or probiotics could be helpful in caries prevention and periodontal disease management, although evidence is limited and biological mechanisms not fully elucidated.

Here we studied causality between the serum uric acid concentration and progression of diabetic nephropathy in 3895 individuals with type 1 diabetes in the FinnDiane Study. The renal status was assessed with the urinary albumin excretion rate and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) at baseline and at the end of the follow-up. Based on previous genomewide association studies on serum uric acid concentration, 23 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with good imputation quality were selected for the SNP score. This score was used to assess the causality between serum uric acid and renal complications using a Mendelian randomization approach. At baseline, the serum uric acid concentration was higher with worsening renal status. In multivariable Cox regression analyses, baseline serum uric acid concentration was not independently associated with progression of diabetic nephropathy over a mean follow-up of 7 years. However, over the same period, baseline serum uric acid was independently associated with the decline in eGFR. In the cross-sectional logistic regression analyses, the SNP score was associated with the serum uric acid concentration. Nevertheless, the Mendelian randomization showed no causality between uric acid and diabetic nephropathy, eGFR categories, or eGFR as a continuous variable. Thus, our results suggest that the serum uric acid concentration is not causally related to diabetic nephropathy but is a downstream marker of kidney damage.</abstracttext>]",['https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0085-2538(16)30757-8']

It is a general expectation that these biomarkers or signatures have not only strong discrimination ability, but also readable interpretations in a biological sense. Generally, the conventional expression-based or network-based methods mainly capture differential genes or differential networks as biomarkers, however, such biomarkers only focus on phenotypic discrimination and usually have less biological or functional interpretation. Meanwhile, the conventional function-based methods could consider the biomarkers corresponding to certain biological functions or pathways, but ignore the differential information of genes, i.e., disregard the active degree of particular genes involved in particular functions, thereby resulting in less discriminative ability on phenotypes. Hence, it is strongly demanded to develop elaborate computational methods to directly identify functional network biomarkers with both discriminative power on disease states and readable interpretation on biological functions.</abstracttext>, <abstracttext label=""RESULTS"" nlmcategory=""RESULTS"">In this paper, we present a new computational framework based on an integer programming model, named as Comparative Network Stratification (CNS), to extract functional or interpretable network biomarkers, which are of strongly discriminative power on disease states and also readable interpretation on biological functions. In addition, CNS can not only recognize the pathogen biological functions disregarded by traditional Expression-based/Network-based methods, but also uncover the active network-structures underlying such dysregulated functions underestimated by traditional Function-based methods. To validate the effectiveness, we have compared CNS with five state-of-the-art methods, i.e. GSVA, Pathifier, stSVM, frSVM and AEP on four datasets of different complex diseases. The results show that CNS can enhance the discriminative power of network biomarkers, and further provide biologically interpretable information or disease pathogenic mechanism of these biomarkers. A case study on type 1 diabetes (T1D) demonstrates that CNS can identify many dysfunctional genes and networks previously disregarded by conventional approaches.</abstracttext>, <abstracttext label=""CONCLUSION"" nlmcategory=""CONCLUSIONS"">Therefore, CNS is actually a powerful bioinformatics tool, which can identify functional or interpretable network biomarkers with both discriminative power on disease states and readable interpretation on biological functions.

It functions as a ligand-activated transcription factor and plays important roles in the regulation of adipocyte differentiation, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and inflammation. Many PPARŒ≥ agonists bind to the canonical ligand-binding pocket near the activation function-2 (AF-2) helix (i.e., helix H12) of the ligand-binding domain (LBD). More recently, an alternate ligand-binding site was identified in PPARŒ≥ LBD; it is located beside the Œ© loop between the helices H2' and H3. We reported previously that the chirality of two optimized enantiomeric PPARŒ≥ ligands (S35 and R35) differentiates their PPARŒ≥ transcriptional activity, binding affinity, and inhibitory activity toward Cdk5 (cyclin-dependent kinase 5)-mediated phosphorylation of PPARŒ≥ at Ser245 (in PPARŒ≥1 numbering; Ser273 in PPARŒ≥2 numbering). S35 is a PPARŒ≥ phosphorylation inhibitor with promising glucose uptake potential, whereas R35 behaves as a potent conventional PPARŒ≥ agonist. To provide a structural basis for understanding the differential activities of these enantiomeric ligands, we have determined crystal structures of the PPARŒ≥ LBD in complex with either S35 or R35. S35 and R35 bind to the PPARŒ≥ LBD in significantly different manners. The partial agonist S35 occupies the alternate site near the Œ© loop, whereas the full agonist R35 binds entirely to the canonical LBP. Alternate site binding of S35 affects the PPARŒ≥ transactivation and the inhibitory effect on PPARŒ≥ Ser245 phosphorylation. This study provides a useful platform for the development of a new generation of PPARŒ≥ ligands as anti-diabetic drug candidates.</abstracttext>]",['https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1570-9639(17)30050-X']

This review examines what has led to the success of a precision medicine approach in monogenic diabetes (precision diabetes) and outlines possible implications for type 2 diabetes. For monogenic diabetes, the molecular genetics can define discrete aetiological subtypes that have profound implications on diabetes treatment and can predict future development of associated clinical features, allowing early preventative or supportive treatment. In contrast, type 2 diabetes has overlapping polygenic susceptibility and underlying aetiologies, making it difficult to define discrete clinical subtypes with a dramatic implication for treatment. The implementation of precision medicine in neonatal diabetes was simple and rapid as it was based on single clinical criteria (diagnosed &lt;6¬†months of age). In contrast, in MODY it was more complex and slow because of the lack of single criteria to identify patients, but it was greatly assisted by the development of a diagnostic probability calculator and associated smartphone app. Experience in monogenic diabetes suggests that successful adoption of a precision diabetes approach in type 2 diabetes will require simple, quick, easily accessible stratification that is based on a combination of routine clinical data, rather than relying on newer technologies.

However, their ability to improve prediction of disease outcomes beyond standard clinical risk factors has been limited.

Pharmacogenetic findings may aid in identifying new drug targets, elucidate pathophysiology, unravel disease heterogeneity, help prioritise specific genes in regions of genetic association, and contribute to personalised or precision treatment. In diabetes, precedent for the successful application of pharmacogenetic concepts exists in its monogenic subtypes, such as MODY or neonatal diabetes. Whether similar insights will emerge for the much more common entity of type 2 diabetes remains to be seen.

The increasing identification of human microbe-disease associations offers important insights into the underlying disease mechanism understanding from the perspective of human microbes, which are greatly helpful for investigating pathogenesis, promoting early diagnosis and improving precision medicine. However, the current knowledge in this domain is still limited and far from complete. Here, we present the computational model of Path-Based Human Microbe-Disease Association prediction (PBHMDA) based on the integration of known microbe-disease associations and the Gaussian interaction profile kernel similarity for microbes and diseases. A special depth-first search algorithm was implemented to traverse all possible paths between microbes and diseases for inferring the most possible disease-related microbes. As a result, PBHMDA obtained a reliable prediction performance with AUCs (The area under ROC curve) of 0.9169 and 0.8767 in the frameworks of both global and local leave-one-out cross validations, respectively. Based on 5-fold cross validation, average AUCs of 0.9082 ¬± 0.0061 further demonstrated the efficiency of the proposed model. For the case studies of liver cirrhosis, type 1 diabetes, and asthma, 9, 7, and 9 out of predicted microbes in the top 10 have been confirmed by previously published experimental literatures, respectively. We have publicly released the prioritized microbe-disease associations, which may help to select the most potential pairs for further guiding the experimental confirmation. In conclusion, PBHMDA may have potential to boost the discovery of novel microbe-disease associations and aid future research efforts toward microbe involvement in human disease mechanism.

Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) is the key regulator of fibrinolysis with increased levels demonstrated in states of pro-thrombosis and abnormal lipid metabolism. Our objective was to develop and validate a canine PAI-1 activity assay and test whether dogs with hyperadrenocorticism or diabetes mellitus that are hyperlipidemic/dyslipidemic have increased plasma PAI-1 activity. Functionally active PAI-1 in the plasma sample was incubated with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), allowing the formation of a 1:1 stoichiometric inactive complex. Residual unbound tPA was then reacted with excess plasminogen in the presence of a colorimetric plasmin substrate. Plasmin production is quantified by computing the area under the curve of time (x) vs optical density (y) plot and converted to tPA IU/mL by comparison to a calibration curve of tPA standards. PAI-1 activity was determined by calculating the proportion of exogeneous tPA suppressed by PAI-1 in plasma. Assay verification included assessment of linearity, specificity, precision, sensitivity, and stability. PAI-1 activity was increased in hyperlipidemic compared to healthy dogs, but there was no significant difference between dogs with hyperadrenocorticism and diabetes mellitus. A near significant decrease in activity was detected in thawed plasma stored for 20h at 4¬∞C. Our successfully validated assay offers a new tool for investigating fibrinolysis in dogs. Investigation of PAI-1 activity in dogs with other diseases associated with an increased risk of thrombosis would be valuable.

The gut microbiome, a key determinant of intestinal inflammation, also plays a direct role in chronic inflammation and liver disease. Gut bacterial communities directly metabolize certain drugs, reducing their bioavailability and influencing individual variation in drug response. In addition, some microbiome-produced compounds may affect drug pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics via altered expression of metabolizing enzymes and drug transporters or genes coding for drug target proteins, drug response phenotypes, and disease states. Molecular-based high-throughput technologies are providing novel insight about host-gut microbiome interactions, homeostasis, and xenobiotic effects associated with wide variation in efficacy or toxicity in humans. It is envisioned that future approaches to treating and preventing liver disease will benefit from in-depth studies of the liver-microbiome axis. Thus, the microbiome shares a fundamental role in human physiology with various organ systems, and its importance must be considered in the rapid evolution of precision medicine.

Confocal analysis of SH-SY5Y cells overexpressing SLC30A9 fused to enhanced green fluorescent protein demonstrated vesicular cytosolic localization associated with the endoplasmic reticulum, not co-localizing with endosomal or Golgi markers. SLC30A9 encodes a putative zinc transporter (by similarity) previously associated with Wnt signalling. However, using dual-luciferase reporter assay in SH-SY5Y cells we showed that Wnt signalling was not affected by the mutation.

Cytosolic Zn2+ measurements in HEK293 cells overexpressing wild-type and mutant SLC30A9 showed lower zinc concentration within mutant rather than wild-type SLC30A9 cells.

Sequence data from the mutant strain is aligned to the reference genome, and then variants are called to generate a list of candidate alleles. A number of software pipelines for mutation identification have been targeted to C. elegans, with particular emphasis on ease of use, incorporation of mapping strain data, subtraction of background variants, and similar criteria. Although success is predicated upon the sensitive and accurate detection of candidate alleles, relatively little effort has been invested in evaluating the underlying software components that are required for mutation identification. Therefore, we have benchmarked a number of commonly used tools for sequence alignment and variant calling, in all pair-wise combinations, against both simulated and actual datasets.

Prior studies indicate that the FADS genes have been subjected to strong positive selection in Africa, South Asia, Greenland, and Europe. By comparing FADS sequencing data from present-day and Bronze Age (5-3k years ago) Europeans, we identify possible targets of selection in the European population, which suggest that selection has targeted different alleles in the FADS genes in Europe than it has in South Asia or Greenland. The alleles showing the strongest changes in allele frequency since the Bronze Age show associations with expression changes and multiple lipid-related phenotypes. Furthermore, the selected alleles are associated with a decrease in linoleic acid and an increase in arachidonic and eicosapentaenoic acids among Europeans; this is an opposite effect of that observed for selected alleles in Inuit from Greenland. We show that multiple SNPs in the region affect expression levels and PUFA synthesis. Additionally, we find evidence for a gene-environment interaction influencing low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels between alleles affecting PUFA synthesis and PUFA dietary intake: carriers of the derived allele display lower LDL cholesterol levels with a higher intake of PUFAs. We hypothesize that the selective patterns observed in Europeans were driven by a change in dietary composition of fatty acids following the transition to agriculture, resulting in a lower intake of arachidonic acid and eicosapentaenoic acid, but a higher intake of linoleic acid and Œ±-linolenic acid.</abstracttext>]",['https://academic.oup.com/mbe/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/molbev/msx103']

By performing interspecies comparisons, we identified hundreds of genes with conserved enriched expression in endocrine and exocrine cells among human, mouse, and zebrafish.

A large set of endocrine-enriched genes can already be detected at early developmental stages as revealed by the transcriptomic profiling of embryonic endocrine cells, indicating a potential role in cell differentiation. The actual involvement of conserved endocrine genes in pancreatic cell differentiation was demonstrated in zebrafish for myt1b, whose invalidation leads to a reduction of alpha cells, and for cdx4, selectively expressed in endocrine delta cells and crucial for their specification.

We sequenced the exome of a child with persistent diazoxide-responsive HH, mild aortic insufficiency, severe hypotonia, and developmental delay as well as the unaffected parents.

We enrolled 28 individuals with diabetes only, 24 with diabetes plus hypertension, 7 with diabetes plus hyperlipidemia, and 11 with diabetes plus both hypertension and hyperlipidemia. Modified midstream urine collection technique was designed to obtain urine specimens. Bacterial genomic DNA was isolated using magnetic beads and the urinary microbiota was analyzed using the Illumina MiSeq Sequencing System based on the V3-V4 hypervariable regions of the 16S rRNA gene. Among the four cohorts, the diabetes plus hypertension cohort had the highest relative abundance of Proteobacteria. In contrast, the diabetes plus hyperlipidemia cohort had the lowest relative abundance of Proteobacteria.

However, it remains unclear whether hypoxia affects the expression of HNF4Œ± in Œ≤-cells. Here, we report that hypoxia reduces HNF4Œ± protein expression in Œ≤-cells. Hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) was not involved in the down-regulation of HNF4Œ± under hypoxic conditions. The down-regulation of HNF4Œ± was dependent on the activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), and the reduction of HNF4Œ± protein expression by metformin, an AMPK activator, and hypoxia was inhibited by the overexpression of a kinase-dead (KD) form of AMPKŒ±2. In addition, hypoxia decreased the stability of HNF4Œ± protein, and the down-regulation of HNF4Œ± was sensitive to proteasome inhibitors. Adenovirus-mediated overexpression of KD-AMPKŒ±2 improved insulin secretion in metformin-treated islets, hypoxic islets, and ob/ob mouse islets.

Clinical development,"[<abstracttext>Type I diabetes manifests in autoimmune destruction of beta cells requiring metabolic management with an exogenous replacement source of insulin, either by repeated injection of recombinant insulin or by transplantation of allogenic islets from cadaveric donors. Both of these approaches have severe limitations. Repeated insulin injection requires intensive blood glucose monitoring, is expensive, and is associated with decreased quality of life measures. Islet transplant, while highly effective, is severely limited by shortage of donor organs. Clinical translation of beta cells derived from pluripotent stem cells is also not yet a reality and alternative approaches to solving the replacement of lost beta cell function are required. In vivo direct reprogramming offers an attractive approach to generating new endogenous insulin secreting cells by permanently altering the phenotype of somatic cells following transient expression of transcription factors. Previously, we have successfully restored control of blood glucose in diabetic mice by reprogramming liver cells into glucose-sensitive insulin secreting cells following the transient, simultaneous delivery of three transcription factors Pdx1, Ngn3 and MafA, to the livers of diabetic mice using an adenovirus vector (Ad-PNM). Establishing a clinically relevant, large animal model is a critical next step in translating this approach beyond the proof of principal stage in rodents and allowing investigation of vector design, dose and delivery, host response to vector infusion and establishment of suitable criteria for measuring safety and efficacy. In this feasibility study we infused Ad-PNM into the liver of three diabetic cynomolgus macaques via portal vein catheter. Vector presence and cargo gene and protein expression was detected in liver tissue after infusion with no adverse effects. Refinement of immune suppression significantly extended the period of exogenous PNM expression.

Visceral tissue is characterized by a higher expression and secretion of interleukin-8, interleukin-1√ü and plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 in the subcutaneous tissue secretion of leptin prevails. An important complication of obesity is obstructive sleep apnea, often observed in Prader- Willi syndrome. The genetic background of sleep apnea may be a polymorphism of the SREBF1 gene. The consequence of excess body mass is metabolic syndrome, which may be related to the occurrence of the rs926198 variant of gene encoding caveolin-1. The genes of transcription factor TCF7L2 and PPAR-Œ≥2 take part in the pathogenesis of diabetes development.

In mice, melanocortin-3 receptor (MC3R) deletion alters nutrient partitioning independently of hyperphagia, promoting accumulation of fat over muscle mass. Enhanced rhythms in insulin and insulin-responsive metabolic genes during hypocaloric feeding suggest partial insulin resistance and enhanced lipogenesis. However, exactly where and how MC3Rs affect metabolic control to alter nutrient partitioning is not known. The behavioral phenotypes exhibited by MC3R-deficient mice suggest a contextual role in appetite control. The impact of MC3R-deficiency on feeding behavior when food is freely available is minor. However, homeostatic responses to hypocaloric conditioning involving increased expression of appetite-stimulating (orexigenic) neuropeptides, binge-feeding, food anticipatory activity (FAA), entrainment to nutrient availability and enhanced feeding-related motivational responses are compromised with MC3R-deficiency. Rescuing <i>Mc3r</i> transcription in hypothalamic and limbic neurons improves appetitive responses during hypocaloric conditioning while having minor effects on nutrient partitioning, suggesting orexigenic functions. Rescuing hypothalamic MC3Rs also restores responses of fasting-responsive hypothalamic orexigenic neurons in hypocaloric conditions, suggesting actions that sensitize fasting-responsive neurons to signals from nutrient sensors. MC3R signaling in ventromedial hypothalamic SF1(+ve) neurons improves metabolic control, but does not restore appetitive responses or nutrient partitioning. In summary, desensitization of fasting-responsive orexigenic neurons may underlie attenuated appetitive responses of MC3R-deficient mice in hypocaloric situations. Further studies are needed to identify the specific location(s) of MC3Rs controlling appetitive responses and partitioning of nutrients between fat and lean tissues.</abstracttext>]",['https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmid/28360832/']

Though mutations of the ADIPOR2 gene are detrimental, there is a lack of comprehensive in silico analyses of the functional and structural impacts at the protein level. Considering the involvement of ADIPOR2 in glucose uptake and fatty acid oxidation, an in silico functional analysis was conducted to explore the possible association between genetic mutations and phenotypic variations. A genomic analysis of 82 nonsynonymous SNPs in ADIPOR2 was initiated using SIFT followed by the SNAP2, nsSNPAnalyzer, PolyPhen-2, SNPs&amp;GO, FATHMM and PROVEAN servers. A total of 10 mutations (R126W, L160Q, L195P, F201S, L235R, L235P, L256R, Y328H, E334K and Q349H) were predicted to have deleterious effects on the ADIPOR2 protein and were therefore selected for further analysis. Theoretical models of the variants were generated by comparative modeling via MODELLER 9.16. A protein structural analysis of these amino acid variants was performed using SNPeffect, I-Mutant, ConSurf, Swiss-PDB Viewer and NetSurfP to explore their solvent accessibility, molecular dynamics and energy minimization calculations. In addition, FTSite was used to predict the ligand binding sites, while NetGlycate, NetPhos2.0, UbPerd and SUMOplot were used to predict post-translational modification sites. All of the variants showed increased free energy, though F201S exhibited the highest energy increase. The root mean square deviation values of the modeled mutants strongly indicated likely pathogenicity. Remarkably, three binding sites were detected on ADIPOR2, and two mutations at positions 328 and 201 were found in the first and second binding pockets, respectively. Interestingly, no mutations were found at the post-translational modification sites. These genetic variants can provide a better understanding of the wide range of disease susceptibility associated with ADIPOR2 and aid the development of new molecular diagnostic markers for these diseases. The findings may also facilitate the development of novel therapeutic elements for associated diseases.</abstracttext>]",[]

Recently, TRPV4 was implicated in controlling peripheral insulin sensitivity, insulin secretion and apoptosis of pancreatic beta cells. Here, we characterize the role and potential mechanisms of TRPV4 in regulating insulin mRNA expression and cell death in insulin producing INS-1E cells and rat pancreatic islets. TRPV4 protein production was downregulated by siRNA. Intracellular calcium level was measured using Fluo-3 AM. Gene expression was studied by real-time PCR. Phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK1 and ERK2) was detected by Western blot. Nitric oxide (NO) production was assessed by chemiluminescent reaction. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) level was analysed using a fluorogenic dye (DCFDA). Cell death was evaluated by determination of cytoplasmic histone-associated DNA fragments. Downregulation of TRPV4 neither affected insulin mRNA expression nor INS-1E cell growth. By contrast, pharmacological TRPV4 activation by 100nmol/l GSK1016790A increased Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels in INS-1E cells and enhanced insulin mRNA expression after 1 and 3h, whereas a suppression of both was detected after 24h incubation. GSK1016790A increased ERK1/2 phosphorylation and NO production but not ROS production. Pharmacological blockade of ERK1/2 attenuated GSK1016790A-induced insulin mRNA expression. Inhibition of NO synthesis by l-NAME failed to affect insulin mRNA expression in GSK1016790A treated INS-1E cells. Furthermore, inhibition of NO production attenuated GSK1016790A-induced INS-1E cell death. In pancreatic islets, 100nmol/l GSK1016790A increased insulin mRNA levels after 3h without inducing cytotoxicity after 24h. In conclusion, TRPV4 differently regulates insulin mRNA expression in INS-1E cells via ERK1/2 and NO-dependent mechanisms.</abstracttext>]",[]

Here we show that differentiation of white and brown adipocytes requires Deleted in Liver Cancer 1 (DLC1), a Rho GTPase Activating Protein (RhoGAP) previously studied for its function in liver cancer. We identified Dlc1 as a super-enhancer associated gene in both white and brown adipocytes through analyzing the genome-wide binding profiles of PPARŒ≥, the master regulator of adipogenesis. We further observed that Dlc1 expression increases during differentiation, and knockdown of Dlc1 by siRNA in white adipocytes reduces the formation of lipid droplets and the expression of fat marker genes. Moreover, knockdown of Dlc1 in brown adipocytes reduces expression of brown fat-specific genes and diminishes mitochondrial respiration. Dlc1-/- knockout mouse embryonic fibroblasts show a complete inability to differentiate into adipocytes, but this phenotype can be rescued by inhibitors of Rho-associated kinase (ROCK) and filamentous actin (F-actin), suggesting the involvement of Rho pathway in DLC1-regulated adipocyte differentiation. Furthermore, PPARŒ≥ binds to the promoter of Dlc1 gene to regulate its expression during both white and brown adipocyte differentiation.

Patients with DCM show symptoms and signs of heart failure while no specific cause, such as coronary disease, hypertension, alcohol consumption, or other structural heart diseases has been identified. The pathogenesis of DCM is complex and has not been well understood until recently. MicroRNAs (miRs) belong to a novel family of highly conserved, short, non-coding, single-stranded RNA molecules that regulate transcriptional and post-transcriptional gene expression. Furthermore, recent studies have demonstrated an association between miRs and DCM. In the current review, the role of miRs in the pathogenesis of DCM is summarized.

To confirm the quality of imputed INDELs and investigate their roles in mediating cardiometabolic phenotypes, genome-wide association and linkage analyses were performed for 15 phenotypes with 1,273,952 imputed INDELs in 1,024 Mexican-origin Americans. Imputation quality was validated using whole exome sequencing with an average kappa of 0.93 in common INDELs (minor allele frequencies [MAFs] ‚â• 5%). Association analysis revealed one genome-wide significant association signal for the cholesterylester transfer protein gene (CETP) with high-density lipoprotein levels (rs36229491, P = 3.06 √ó 10<sup>-12</sup> ); linkage analysis identified two peaks with logarithm of the odds (LOD) &gt; 5 (rs60560566, LOD = 5.36 with insulin sensitivity (S<sub>I</sub> ) and rs5825825, LOD = 5.11 with adiponectin levels). Suggestive overlapping signals between linkage and association were observed: rs59849892 in the WSC domain containing 2 gene (WSCD2) was associated and nominally linked with S<sub>I</sub> (P = 1.17 √ó 10<sup>-7</sup> , LOD = 1.99). This gene has been implicated in glucose metabolism in human islet cell expression studies. In addition, rs201606363 was linked and nominally associated with low-density lipoprotein (P = 4.73 √ó 10<sup>-4</sup> , LOD = 3.67), apolipoprotein B (P = 1.39 √ó 10<sup>-3</sup> , LOD = 4.64), and total cholesterol (P = 1.35 √ó 10<sup>-2</sup> , LOD = 3.80) levels. rs201606363 is an intronic variant of the UBE2F-SCLY (where UBE2F is ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2F and SCLY is selenocysteine lyase) fusion gene that may regulate cholesterol through selenium metabolism. In conclusion, these results confirm the feasibility of imputing INDELs from array-based single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotypes. Analysis of these variants using association and linkage replicated previously identified SNP signals and identified multiple novel INDEL signals.

Such tumours provide an opportunity to discover common co-operative changes required for tumorigenesis, while controlling for the genetic background of the individual. We performed genomic analysis of synchronous and metachronous tumours from five patients bearing germline mutations in the genes SDHB, RET and MAX.

We also applied multi-regional sampling, to assess intra-tumoral heterogeneity and clonal evolution, in two cases involving phaeochromocytoma/paraganglioma and medullary thyroid cancer, respectively. Heterogeneous patterns of genomic change existed between synchronous or metachronous tumours, with evidence of branching evolution. We observed striking examples of evolutionary convergence involving the same rare somatic copy-number events in synchronous primary phaeochromocytoma/paraganglioma. Convergent events also occurred during clonal evolution of metastatic medullary thyroid cancer.

Maret W.,2017,28401081,"Zinc in Pancreatic Islet Biology, Insulin Sensitivity, and Diabetes.",Preventive nutrition and food science,"[<abstracttext>About 20 chemical elements are nutritionally essential for humans with defined molecular functions. Several essential and nonessential biometals are either functional nutrients with antidiabetic actions or can be diabetogenic. A key question remains whether changes in the metabolism of biometals and biominerals are a consequence of diabetes or are involved in its etiology. Exploration of the roles of zinc (Zn) in this regard is most revealing because 80 years of scientific discoveries link zinc and diabetes. In pancreatic Œ≤- and Œ±-cells, zinc has specific functions in the biochemistry of insulin and glucagon. When zinc ions are secreted during vesicular exocytosis, they have autocrine, paracrine, and endocrine roles. The membrane protein ZnT8 transports zinc ions into the insulin and glucagon granules. ZnT8 has a risk allele that predisposes the majority of humans to developing diabetes. In target tissues, increased availability of zinc enhances the insulin response by inhibiting protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B, which controls the phosphorylation state of the insulin receptor and hence downstream signalling. Inherited diseases of zinc metabolism, environmental exposures that interfere with the control of cellular zinc homeostasis, and nutritional or conditioned zinc deficiency influence the patho-biochemistry of diabetes. Accepting the view that zinc is one of the many factors in multiple gene-environment interactions that cause the functional demise of Œ≤-cells generates an immense potential for treating and perhaps preventing diabetes. Personalized nutrition, bioactive food, and pharmaceuticals targeting the control of cellular zinc in precision medicine are among the possible interventions.</abstracttext>]",[]

When scaffolds containing lysates from an insulin-producing Œ≤-cell line were implanted subcutaneously in autoimmune diabetes prone NOD mice, Œ≤-cell reactive T cells homed to these scaffolds and became enriched. These T cells induced diabetes after adoptive transfer, indicating their pathogenicity. Furthermore, T cell receptor (TCR) sequencing identified many expanded TCRs within the Œ≤-cell scaffolds that were also expanded within the pancreases of NOD mice.

Three novel variants (Y106H, A240_A249del, and P197delfs*206) resulting in an amino acid substitution, loss of 9 amino acids, and a frameshift stop mutation, respectively, were identified only in low-dose-requiring women. Nine non-synonymous variants were unique to the high-dose-requiring group. These included three known variants (R151C, G221S, and W228C) and six novel variants not found in Ensembl or ExAC (M133V, R150L, H173R, A248V, G253R, and I266V). Of these, R150L, R151C, and H173R were predicted to damage oxytocin receptor function. There was no statistically significant association between the numbers of synonymous and non-synonymous substitutions in the patient groups.</abstracttext>, <abstracttext label=""CONCLUSIONS"" nlmcategory=""CONCLUSIONS"">Obesity, diabetes, and labor induction were associated with the requirement for high doses of oxytocin. We did not identify significant differences in the prevalence of oxytocin receptor variants between low-dose-requiring and high-dose-requiring women, but novel oxytocin receptor variants were enriched in the high-dose-requiring women. Additionally, we found three oxytocin receptor variants (two novel, one known) that were predicted to damage oxytocin receptor function and would likely increase an individual's risk for requiring a high oxytocin dose. Further investigation of oxytocin receptor variants and their effects on protein function will inform precision medicine in pregnant women.</abstracttext>]",[]

Accentuating endogenous energy expenditure has been accorded considerable attention ever since the presence of brown adipose tissue (BAT) in adult humans was recognized, given that BAT is known to increase energy expenditure via thermogenesis. Besides classic BAT, significant strides in our understanding of inducible brown adipocytes have been made regarding its development and function. While it is ideal to study BAT histologically, its relatively inaccessible anatomical locations and the inherent risks associated with biopsy preclude invasive techniques to evaluate BAT on a routine basis. Thus, there has been a surge in interest to employ non-invasive methods to examine BAT. The gold standard of non-invasive detection of BAT activation is <sup>18</sup>F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (PET) with computed tomography (CT). However, a major limitation of PET/CT as a tool for human BAT studies is the clinically significant doses of ionizing radiation. More recently, several other imaging methods, including single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), infrared thermography (IRT)/thermal imaging and contrast ultrasonography (US) have been developed in hopes that they would allow non-invasive, quantitative measures of BAT mass and activity with lower costs. This review focuses on such methods to detect human BAT activation and white adipose tissue (WAT) browning to prompt the establishment of BAT-centric strategies for augmenting energy expenditure and combatting obesity. Clinical validation of these methods will most likely expand the scope and flexibility of future BAT studies.</abstracttext>]",['http://www.masson.fr/masson/S1262-3636(17)30063-0']
"Thomsen SK, Gloyn AL.",2017,28447115,Human genetics as a model for target validation: finding new therapies for diabetes.,Diabetologia,"[<abstracttext>Type 2 diabetes is a global epidemic with major effects on healthcare expenditure and quality of life. Currently available treatments are inadequate for the prevention of comorbidities, yet progress towards new therapies remains slow. A major barrier is the insufficiency of traditional preclinical models for predicting drug efficacy and safety. Human genetics offers a complementary model to assess causal mechanisms for target validation. Genetic perturbations are 'experiments of nature' that provide a uniquely relevant window into the long-term effects of modulating specific targets. Here, we show that genetic discoveries over the past decades have accurately predicted (now known) therapeutic mechanisms for type 2 diabetes. These findings highlight the potential for use of human genetic variation for prospective target validation, and establish a framework for future applications. Studies into rare, monogenic forms of diabetes have also provided proof-of-principle for precision medicine, and the applicability of this paradigm to complex disease is discussed. Finally, we highlight some of the limitations that are relevant to the use of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in the search for new therapies for diabetes. A key outstanding challenge is the translation of GWAS signals into disease biology and we outline possible solutions for tackling this experimental bottleneck.</abstracttext>]",['https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00125-017-4270-y']

Increases in blood flux at a control electrode, containing the diluent only, indicated a non-specific response.

He had known progressive and widespread bony metastases, for which he received palliative radiotherapy, and multiple bilateral asymptomatic pulmonary metastases. CT scan and MRI of the spine revealed metastases at right T10-L1 vertebrae with extension into the central canal and epidural disease at T10 and T11 causing cord displacement and canal stenosis but retention of spinal cord signal. Spinal surgery was followed by palliative radiotherapy resulting in symptom resolution. Two months later, sorafenib received approval for use in Australia and was commenced and up-titrated with symptomatic management of mild adverse effects. Follow-up CT scan three months after commencement of sorafenib revealed regression of pulmonary metastases but no evident change in most bone metastases except for an advancing lesion eroding into the right acetabulum.

Our analysis reveals that the most strongly disallowed genes are similar in beta and alpha cells, with 11Œ≤-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (<i>Hsd11b1)</i> mRNA being essentially undetectable in both cell types. The analysis also reveals that several genes involved in cellular proliferation, including <i>Yap1</i> and <i>Igfbp</i>4, and previously assumed to be disallowed in both beta and alpha cells, are selectively repressed only in the beta cell. The latter finding supports the view that beta cell growth is selectively restricted in adults, providing a mechanism to avoid excessive insulin production and the risk of hypoglycaemia. Approaches which increase the expression or activity of selected disallowed genes in the beta cell may provide the basis for novel regenerative therapies in type 2 diabetes.</abstracttext>]","['https://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fgene.2017.00041', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmid/28443133/']"

Part A,"[<abstracttext>Chromosome 22q11.2 deletion is the most common chromosomal alteration associated with DiGeorge syndrome (DGS), even though this is not the only underlying cause of DGS. In rare patients, mutations in a single gene, TBX1, have been described resulting in a DGS phenotype. Recently, it has been reported that at least part of the TBX1 mutant phenotype is due to excessive bone morphogenetic proteins (BMP) signaling. Evidence suggests that miRNA may modulate the expression of critical T-box transcriptional regulators during midface development and Bmp-signaling. We report on a 7-year-old Caucasian male born to a mother affected with gestational diabetes (GDM) who had a 371Kb-interstitial deletion of 3p12.3 identified by array CGH, involving the ZNF717, MIR1243, and 4273 genes. The child presented with a DiGeorge anomaly (DGA) associated with unilateral renal agenesis and language delay. The immunological evaluation revealed a severe reduction and impairment of T lymphocytes. FISH analysis and TBX1 sequencing were negative. Among the miRNA-4273 predicted target genes, we found BMP3, which is involved in several steps of embryogenesis including kidney and lung organogenesis and in insulin gene expression. Since, DGA is not commonly found in newborns of diabetic mothers, we hypothesize that the pathogenesis of DGA associated with GDM is multifactorial, involving both genetic and/or epigenetic cofactors.</abstracttext>]",['http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ajmg.a.38242']

Microbial genes are essential for key metabolic processes, such as the breakdown of indigestible dietary fibres to short-chain fatty acids, biosynthesis of amino acids and vitamins, and production of neurotransmitters and hormones. During the last decade, evidence has accumulated to support a role for gut microbiota (analysed from faecal samples) in glycaemic control and type 2 diabetes. Mechanistic studies in mice support a causal role for gut microbiota in metabolic diseases, although human data favouring causality is insufficient. As it may be challenging to sort the human evidence from the large number of animal studies in the field, there is a need to provide a review of human studies. Thus, the aim of this review is to cover the current and future possibilities and challenges of using the gut microbiota, with its capacity to be modified, in the development of preventive and treatment strategies for hyperglycaemia and type 2 diabetes in humans. We discuss what is known about the composition and functionality of human gut microbiota in type 2 diabetes and summarise recent evidence of current treatment strategies that involve, or are based on, modification of gut microbiota (diet, probiotics, metformin and bariatric surgery). We go on to review some potential future gut-based glucose-lowering approaches involving microbiota, including the development of personalised nutrition and probiotic approaches, identification of therapeutic components of probiotics, targeted delivery of propionate in the proximal colon, targeted delivery of metformin in the lower gut, faecal microbiota transplantation, and the incorporation of genetically modified bacteria that express therapeutic factors into microbiota. Finally, future avenues and challenges for understanding the interplay between human nutrition, genetics and microbial genetics, and the need for integration of human multi-omic data (such as genetics, transcriptomics, epigenetics, proteomics and metabolomics) with microbiome data (such as strain-level variation, transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics) to make personalised treatments a successful future reality are discussed.</abstracttext>]",['https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00125-017-4278-3']

However, the mechanisms by which EBF2 regulates chromatin to activate brown fat-specific genes in adipocytes were unknown. ChIP-seq (chromatin immunoprecipitation [ChIP] followed by deep sequencing) analyses in brown adipose tissue showed that EBF2 binds and regulates the activity of lineage-specific enhancers. Mechanistically, EBF2 physically interacts with the chromatin remodeler BRG1 and the BAF chromatin remodeling complex in brown adipocytes. We identified the histone reader protein DPF3 as a brown fat-selective component of the BAF complex that was required for brown fat gene programming and mitochondrial function. Loss of DPF3 in brown adipocytes reduced chromatin accessibility at EBF2-bound enhancers and led to a decrease in basal and catecholamine-stimulated expression of brown fat-selective genes. Notably, <i>Dpf3</i> is a direct transcriptional target of EBF2 in brown adipocytes, thereby establishing a regulatory module through which EBF2 activates and also recruits DPF3-anchored BAF complexes to chromatin. Together, these results reveal a novel mechanism by which EBF2 cooperates with a tissue-specific chromatin remodeling complex to activate brown fat identity genes.</abstracttext>]",['http://www.genesdev.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=28428261']

Mature adipocytes were isolated from epididymal and inguinal adipose tissues of ob/ob and DIO C57BL/6J mice. DNA methylation was analyzed by MeDIP-sequencing and gene expression by microarray analysis. The majority of differentially methylated regions (DMRs) were hypomethylated in obese mice. Global methylation of long interspersed elements indicated that hypomethylation did not reflect methyl donor deficiency. In both DIO and ob/ob mice, we observed more obesity-associated methylation changes in epididymal than in inguinal adipocytes. Assignment of DMRs to promoter, exon, intron and intergenic regions demonstrated that DIO-induced changes in DNA methylation in C57BL/6J mice occurred primarily in exons, whereas inguinal adipocytes of ob/ob mice exhibited a higher enrichment of DMRs in promoter regions than in other regions of the genome, suggesting an influence of leptin on DNA methylation in inguinal adipocytes. We observed altered methylation and expression of 9 genes in epididymal adipocytes, including the known obesity-associated genes, Ehd2 and Kctd15, and a novel candidate gene, Irf8, possibly involved in immune type 1/type2 balance.

Only very few loci have been replicated in African ancestry populations and the identification of the implicated functional genes remain largely undefined. We used genetic maps that capture detailed linkage disequilibrium information in European and African Americans and applied these to large T2D case-control samples in order to estimate locations for putative functional variants in both populations. Replicated T2D locations were tested for evidence of being regulatory hotspots using adipose expression. We validated a sample of our co-location intervals using next generation sequencing and functional annotation, including enhancers, transcription, and chromatin modifications. We identified 111 additional disease-susceptibility locations, 93 of which are cosmopolitan and 18 of which are European specific. We show that many previously known signals are also risk loci in African Americans. The majority of the disease locations appear to confer risk of T2D via the regulation of expression levels for a large number (266) of cis-regulated genes, the majority of which are not the nearest genes to the disease loci. Sequencing three cosmopolitan locations provided candidate functional variants that precisely co-locate with cell-specific chromatin domains and pancreatic islet enhancers. These variants have large effect sizes and are common across populations. Results show that disease-associated loci in different populations, gene expression, and cell-specific regulatory annotation can be effectively integrated by localizing these effects on high-resolution genetic maps.

The clinical complications associated with hyperglycemia are attributed, in part, to the increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Recent studies revealed that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play important regulatory roles in many biological processes. Specifically, lncRNA Lethe has been described as exhibiting an anti-inflammatory effect by binding to the p65 subunit of NFŒ∫B and blocking its binding to DNA and the subsequent activation of downstream genes. We therefore hypothesize that dysregulation of Lethe's expression plays a role in hyperglycemia-induced ROS production. To test our hypothesis, we treated RAW264.7 macrophages with low glucose (5 mM) or high glucose (25 mM) for 24h. High glucose conditions significantly induced ROS production and NOX2 gene expression in RAW cells, while significantly decreasing Lethe gene expression. Overexpression of Lethe in RAW cells eliminated the increased ROS production induced by high glucose conditions, while also attenuating the upregulation of NOX2 expression. Similar results was found also in non-diabetic and diabetic primary macrophage, bone marrow derived macrophage (BMM). Furthermore, overexpression of Lethe in RAW cells treated with high glucose significantly reduced the translocation of p65-NFkB to the nucleus, which resulted in decreased NOX2 expression and ROS production. Interestingly, these findings are consistent with the decreased Lethe gene expression and increased NOX2 gene expression observed in a mouse model of diabetic wound healing. These findings provide the first evidence that lncRNA Lethe is involved in the regulation of ROS production in macrophages through modulation of NOX2 gene expression via NFŒ∫B signaling. Moreover, this is the first report to describe a role of lncRNAs, in particular Lethe, in impaired diabetic wound healing. Further studies are warranted to determine if correction of Lethe expression in diabetic wounds could improve healing.</abstracttext>]",['http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0177453']

This increasing popularity may be attributed to the natural occurrence of instrumental variables in observational studies that incorporate elements of randomization, either by design or by nature (e.g., random inheritance of genes). Instrumental variables estimation of exposure effects is well established for continuous outcomes and to some extent for binary outcomes. It is, however, largely lacking for time-to-event outcomes because of complications due to censoring and survivorship bias. In this article, we make a novel proposal under a class of structural cumulative survival models which parameterize time-varying effects of a point exposure directly on the scale of the survival function; these models are essentially equivalent with a semi-parametric variant of the instrumental variables additive hazards model. We propose a class of recursive instrumental variable estimators for these exposure effects, and derive their large sample properties along with inferential tools. We examine the performance of the proposed method in simulation studies and illustrate it in a Mendelian randomization study to evaluate the effect of diabetes on mortality using data from the Health and Retirement Study.

Meta-analyses were performed in OMiCC using comparisons constructed by the participants to identify 1) gene expression signatures for each disease (disease versus healthy controls at the gene expression and biological pathway levels), 2) conserved signatures across all diseases within each species (pan-disease signatures), and 3) conserved signatures between species for each disease and across all diseases (cross-species signatures). <b>Results:</b> A large number of differentially expressed genes were identified for each disease based on meta-analysis, with observed overlap among diseases both within and across species.

Phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate 5-kinases (PIP5Ks) are the main enzymes involved in PIP2 biosynthesis by phosphorylating phosphatidylinositol 4-monophosphate (PI4P) at the D5 position of the inositol ring. In human T lymphocytes, we recently found that CD28 costimulatory molecule is pivotal for PIP2 turnover by recruiting and activating PIP5KŒ±. We also found that PIP5KŒ± is the main regulator of both CD28 costimulatory signals integrating those delivered by TCR as well as CD28 autonomous signals regulating the expression of pro-inflammatory genes. Given emerging studies linking alterations of PIP2 metabolism to immune-based diseases, PIP5KŒ± may represent a promising target to modulate immunity and inflammation. Herewith, we characterized a recently discovered inhibitor of PIP5KŒ±, ISA-2011B, for its inhibitory effects on T lymphocyte functions. We found that the inhibition of PIP5KŒ± lipid-kinase activity by ISA-2011B significantly impaired CD28 costimulatory signals necessary for TCR-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx, NF-AT transcriptional activity, and IL-2 gene expression as well as CD28 autonomous signals regulating the activation of NF-Œ∫B and the transcription of pro-inflammatory cytokine and chemokine genes.

PRIM mice featured increased lipogenic gene expression in liver and adipose tissue. Their selective, liver-specific insulin resistance was associated with increased C18:1-diacylglycerol (DAG) content and protein kinase C (PKC)Œµ translocation. SEC mice had decreased hepatic ChREBP-mediated lipogenesis and featured portal/lobular inflammation along with total, whole-body insulin resistance. Hepatic mitochondrial respiration transiently increased and declined with aging along with higher muscle reactive oxygen species production.

Its canonical target, mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), plays a key role in metabolism and binds chromatin; however, its precise role in the male germ line has not been elucidated. Here, we inactivate the core component, Raptor, to show that mTORC1 function is critical for male meiosis and the inactivation of sex chromosomes. Disruption of the <i>Raptor</i> gene impairs chromosomal synapsis and prevents the efficient spreading of silencing factors into the XY chromatin. Accordingly, mRNA for XY-linked genes remains inappropriately expressed in <i>Raptor</i>-deficient mice. Molecularly, the failure to suppress gene expression corresponded with deficiencies in 2 repressive chromatin markers, H3K9 dimethylation and H3K9 trimethylation, in the XY body.

We measured the temporal trends of glucose homeostasis, insulin secretion, Œ≤-cell morphometry, and islet gene expression in C57BL/6NTac mice fed a 60% high fat (HFD) or control diet for up to 16 weeks. A two-fold increased hyperinsulinemia was maintained for the first 4 weeks of HFD, and then further increased through 16 weeks. Œ≤-cell mass increased progressively starting at 4 weeks, principally through nonproliferative growth. Insulin sensitivity was not significantly perturbed until 11 weeks of HFD. Over the first 8 weeks, we observed two distinct waves of increased expression of Œ≤-cell functional and prodifferentiation genes. This was followed by activation of the uncoupled protein response at 8 weeks and overt Œ≤-cell endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress at 12-16 weeks.

However continued HFD exposure results in cessation of the gene hyperexpression and in Œ≤-cell functional failure and ER stress.

These diseases are kidney cancer, chronic kidney diseases, liver cancer, diabetes, drug addiction, poisoning cases, consequences of falls, and Alzheimer's disease (AD) as one of the leading pathologies. There are familial AD of hereditary nature (~4% of cases) and sporadic AD of unclear etiology (remaining ~96% of cases; i.e., non-familial AD). Therefore, sporadic AD is no longer a purely medical problem, but rather a social challenge when someone asks oneself: ""What can I do in my own adulthood to reduce the risk of sporadic AD at my old age to save the years of my lifespan from the destruction caused by it?"" Here, we combine two computational approaches for regulatory SNPs: Web service SNP_TATA_Comparator for sequence analysis and a PubMed-based keyword search for articles on the biochemical markers of diseases. Our purpose was to try to find answers to the question: ""What can be done in adulthood to reduce the risk of sporadic AD in old age to prevent the lifespan reduction caused by it?""

In addition, rs768454929, and rs761695685 correlate with sporadic AD as a comorbidity of short stature, where maximizing stature in childhood and adolescence as an integral indicator of health can minimize (or even eliminate) the risk of sporadic AD in the elderly.

MATERIAL AND METHODS The CA microsatellite and SNPs were genotyped in 389 type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients. A 75 g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was given to all the participants. Associations of the genotypes and haplotypes with insulin sensitivity, insulin secretion, glucose tolerance, and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) were analyzed by ANCOVA (general linear model) and multiple linear regression, after controlling for gender, age, and BMI. RESULTS The CA microsatellite, rs35767 polymorphisms, and SNP haplotypes with or without CA showed no significant association with metabolic parameters. The C allele of rs5742612 was found to be associated with decreased insulin sensitivity (HOMA-S index, Œ≤=-0.131, P=0.008; fasting insulin level, Œ≤=0.022, P=0.006) and increased insulin secretion (HOMA-B index, Œ≤=0.099, P=0.008; insulin AUC, Œ≤=0.112, P=0.012). The linear regression model also indicated that the A allele of rs2288377 was associated with decreased insulin sensitivity (HOMA-S index, Œ≤=-0.159, P=0.001; fasting insulin, Œ≤=0.143, P=0.001) and increased insulin secretion (HOMA-B index, Œ≤=0.114, P=0.017; insulin AUC, Œ≤=0.042, P=0.002). CONCLUSIONS The CA microsatellite and rs35767 have no genotype-related difference in insulin sensitivity or secretion.

In developing countries, such as Mexico, its prevalence represents an important public health and research issue. Determining factors triggering T2DM are environmental and genetic. While diet, exercise and proper weight control are the first measures recommended to improve the quality of life and life expectancy of patients, pharmacological treatment is usually the next step. Within every population there are variations in interindividual drug response, which may be due to genetic background. Some of the most frequent first line T2DM treatments in developing countries are sulfonylureas (SU), whose targets are ATP-sensitive potassium channels (K<sub>ATP</sub>). Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the K<sub>ATP</sub> coding genes, potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily J member 11 (<i>KCNJ11</i>) and ATP binding cassette subfamily C member 8 (<i>ABCC8</i>) have been associated with SU response variability. To date, there is little information regarding the mechanism by which these SNPs work within Mexican populations. The present study describes the distribution of three SNPs [KCNJ11 rs5219 (E23K), ABCC8 rs757110 (S1369A) and rs1799854 (-3C/T)] among Mestizo Mexican (MM) T2DM patients, and compares it with published data on various healthy subjects and T2DM populations. Through this comparison, no difference in the <i>KCNJ11</i> rs5219 and ABCC8 rs757110 allelic and genotypic frequencies in MM were observed compared with the majority of the reported populations of healthy and diabetic individuals among other ethnic groups; except for African and Colombian individuals. By contrast, ABCC8 rs1799854 genomic and allelic frequencies among MM were observed to be significantly different from those reported by the 1000 Genomes Project, and from diabetic patients within other populations reported in the literature, such as the European, Asian and Latin-American individuals [T=0.704, G=0.296; CC=0.506, CT=0.397, TT=0.097; 95% confidence interval (CI); P‚â§0.05]; except for South Asian and Iberian populations, which may reflect the admixture origins of the present Mexican population. This genetic similarity has not been observed in the other Latin-American groups.

However, the underlying biological mechanisms for many of these associations remain unknown. GWAS signals close to the glucokinase regulatory protein gene (GCKR) have been reported for lipid and glucose metabolism traits and the risk of T2D. We investigated the regulatory function of an intronic locus at GCKR represented by the lead single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs780094.</abstracttext>, <abstracttext label=""METHODS"" nlmcategory=""METHODS"">We used ENCODE project histone modification and transcription factor binding data to determine the regulatory features of a GCKR intronic locus formed by the high linkage disequilibrium rs780094(C/T), rs780095(G/A), and rs780096(G/C) SNPs. Characterization of the transcriptional activity of this region was assessed by luciferase reporter assays in HepG2 cells and mouse primary hepatocytes. ChIP-qPCR was used to determine the levels of haplotype specific transcription factor binding and histone marks. A CRISPR-dCas9 transcriptional activator system and qPCR were used to activate the locus and measure GCKR expression, respectively. Differential haplotype expression was measured from human liver biopsies.</abstracttext>, <abstracttext label=""RESULTS"" nlmcategory=""RESULTS"">The ENCODE data suggest the existence of a liver-specific intragenic enhancer at the locus represented by s780094. We observed that FOXA2 increased the transcriptional activity of this region in a haplotype specific way (CGG‚Äâ&gt;‚ÄâTAC; rs780094, rs780095, and rs780096). In addition, the CGG haplotype showed higher binding to FOXA2 and higher levels of the H3K27Ac histone mark. The epigenetic activation of this locus increased the expression of endogenous GCKR in HepG2 cells, confirming that GCKR is the direct target gene of the enhancer. Finally, we confirmed that the CGG haplotype exhibits higher levels of transcription in human liver.</abstracttext>, <abstracttext label=""CONCLUSIONS"" nlmcategory=""CONCLUSIONS"">Our results demonstrate the existence of a liver-specific FOXA2-regulated transcriptional enhancer at an intronic T2D locus represented by rs780094, rs780095, and rs780096 SNPs that increases GCKR expression.

LIPGENE-SU.VI.MAX focuses on the need to account for both phenotypic and genetic factors when studying the metabolic syndrome (MetS), a complex disorder that can lead to higher risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Interest lies in clustering the LIPGENE-SU.VI.MAX participants into homogeneous groups or sub-phenotypes, by jointly considering their phenotypic and genotypic data, and in determining which variables are discriminatory. A novel latent variable model that elegantly accommodates high dimensional, mixed data is developed to cluster LIPGENE-SU.VI.MAX participants using a Bayesian finite mixture model. A computationally efficient variable selection algorithm is incorporated, estimation is via a Gibbs sampling algorithm and an approximate BIC-MCMC criterion is developed to select the optimal model. Two clusters or sub-phenotypes ('healthy' and 'at risk') are uncovered. A small subset of variables is deemed discriminatory, which notably includes phenotypic and genotypic variables, highlighting the need to jointly consider both factors. Further, 7¬†years after the LIPGENE-SU.VI.MAX data were collected, participants underwent further analysis to diagnose presence or absence of the MetS. The two uncovered sub-phenotypes strongly correspond to the 7-year follow-up disease classification, highlighting the role of phenotypic and genotypic factors in the MetS and emphasising the potential utility of the clustering approach in early screening. Additionally, the ability of the proposed approach to define the uncertainty in sub-phenotype membership at the participant level is synonymous with the concepts of precision medicine and nutrition.

Although obesity is simply caused by increased adipose mass, the heterogeneity of adipose tissue in humans means that the response to increased energy balance is highly complex. Individual subjects with similar phenotypes may respond very differently to the same treatments; therefore, obesity may benefit from a personalized precision medicine approach. The variability in the development of obesity is indeed driven by differences in sex, genetics, and environment, but also by the various types of adipose tissue as well as the different cell types that compose it. By describing the distinct cell populations that reside in different fat depots, we can interpret the complex effect of these various players in the maintenance of whole-body energy homeostasis. To further understand adipose tissue, adipogenic differentiation and the transcriptional program of lipid accumulation must be investigated. As the cell- and depot-specific functions are described, they can be placed in the context of energy excess to understand how the heterogeneity of adipose tissue shapes individual metabolic status and condition.</abstracttext>]",['http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/nyas.13398']

How can we infer on diabetes from large heterogeneous datasets? A possible solution is provided by invoking next-generation computational methods and data analytics tools within systems medicine approaches. By deciphering the multi-faceted complexity of biological systems, the potential of emerging diagnostic tools and therapeutic functions can be ultimately revealed. In diabetes, a multidimensional approach to data analysis is needed to better understand the disease conditions, trajectories and the associated comorbidities. Elucidation of multidimensionality comes from the analysis of factors such as disease phenotypes, marker types, and biological motifs while seeking to make use of multiple levels of information including genetics, omics, clinical data, and environmental and lifestyle factors. Examining the synergy between multiple dimensions represents a challenge. In such regard, the role of Big Data fuels the rise of Precision Medicine by allowing an increasing number of descriptions to be captured from individuals. Thus, data curations and analyses should be designed to deliver highly accurate predicted risk profiles and treatment recommendations. It is important to establish linkages between systems and precision medicine in order to translate their principles into clinical practice. Equivalently, to realize their full potential, the involved multiple dimensions must be able to process information ensuring inter-exchange, reducing ambiguities and redundancies, and ultimately improving health care solutions by introducing clinical decision support systems focused on reclassified phenotypes (or digital biomarkers) and community-driven patient stratifications.</abstracttext>]",['https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s40169-017-0155-4']

However, what is not widely appreciated is that HbA<sub>1c</sub> may not be a good indicator of an individual patient's glycemic control because of the wide range of mean glucose concentrations and glucose profiles that can be associated with a given HbA<sub>1c</sub> level. To illustrate this point, we plotted mean glucose measured with continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) versus central laboratory-measured HbA<sub>1c</sub> in 387 participants in three randomized trials, showing that not infrequently HbA<sub>1c</sub> may underestimate or overestimate mean glucose, sometimes substantially. Thus, if HbA<sub>1c</sub> is to be used to assess glycemic control, it is imperative to know the patient's actual mean glucose to understand how well HbA<sub>1c</sub> is an indicator of the patient's glycemic control. With knowledge of the mean glucose, an estimated HbA<sub>1c</sub> (eA1C) can be calculated with the formula provided in this article to compare with the measured HbA<sub>1c</sub>. Estimating glycemic control from HbA<sub>1c</sub> alone is in essence applying a population average to an individual, which can be misleading. Thus, a patient's CGM glucose profile has considerable value for optimizing his or her diabetes management. In this era of personalized, precision medicine, there are few better examples with respect to the fallacy of applying a population average to a specific patient rather than using specific information about the patient to determine the optimal approach to treatment.</b></abstracttext>]",['http://care.diabetesjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=28733374']

In this paper we consider elliptical coordinated compound noun phrases that authors use to save space in an article. Systems that do not attend to coordination would incorrectly interpret ""breast or lung cancer"" as a body part (breast) and a disease (lung cancer) rather than two diseases. The algorithmic approach introduced in this paper uses a generate-and-test strategy where candidate expansions for forward, backward and complex ellipses are generated from syntactic dependencies. Dependencies are also used to create a dictionary of non-coordinated noun phrases that is used during the test phrase. Experiments on 21,280 full-text articles show that more than a million noun phrases were impacted by coordinated ellipses. The system achieves 73.07% precision, 75.38% recall, 74.23% F-score and 94.72% accuracy for new noun phrases in the development set. The precision was higher for backward (82.62 vs. 78.63) and forward expansions (64.82 vs. 60.17) and lower for complex expansions (63.41 vs. 72.59) in a test set.

We¬†recently identified a risk haplotype spanning SLC16A11 that explains ‚àº20% of the increased T2D prevalence in Mexico. Here, through genetic fine-mapping, we define a set of tightly linked variants likely to contain the causal allele(s). We show that variants on the T2D-associated haplotype have two distinct effects: (1) decreasing SLC16A11 expression in liver and (2) disrupting a key interaction with basigin, thereby reducing cell-surface localization. Both independent mechanisms reduce SLC16A11 function and suggest SLC16A11 is the causal gene at¬†this locus. To gain insight into how SLC16A11 disruption impacts T2D risk, we demonstrate that SLC16A11 is a proton-coupled monocarboxylate transporter and that genetic perturbation of SLC16A11 induces changes in fatty acid and lipid metabolism that are associated with increased T2D risk.

Major interference in plasma of human and animals and low fragment signal in tandem mass spectrometry are the main difficulties encountered in the bioanalysis of liraglutide. In this study, by combining differential mobility spectrometry (DMS) with multiple ion monitoring detection (MIM), a liquid chromatography differential mobility spectrometry tandem mass spectrometry with multiple ion monitoring detection (LC-DMS-MIM) method was developed for the quantitation of liraglutide in dog plasma. Mixed anion-exchange solid-phase extraction was used for sample preparation. The parameters of DMS were meticulously optimized to increase the signal-to-noise ratio of the analyte. The assay was linear in the range 1-100¬†ng/mL with good accuracy and precision. The lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ, the lowest standard on the calibration curve) of this method was 1¬†ng/mL.

Several studies have examined virulence genes in H. pylori from Bangladesh. We analyzed cagA and vacA subtypes and their association with severe histology phenotypes, and analyzed population types among Bangladeshi strains. We included patients who underwent endoscopy in Dhaka. Sequences of virulence genes and seven housekeeping genes were obtained by next generation sequencing and confirmed by Sanger sequencing. We isolated 56 H. pylori strains from 133 patients, of which 73.2% carried cagA, and all were considered Western-type. Patients infected with cagA-positive strains had more severe histological scores than patients infected with cagA-negative strains. Among vacA s1 and m1 genotypes, the s1a (97.8%, 43/44) and m1c (28/30, 93.3%) genotypes were predominant. All strains containing s1 and m1 (30/56, 53.6%) also had i1, d1, and c1. In contrast, all strains containing the less-virulent genotypes s2 and m2 (12/56, 21.4%) also possessed i2, d2, and c2. Multivariate analysis indicated that subjects infected with vacA m1-genotype strains only had a significantly higher risk of antrum atrophy than patients infected with m2-genotype strains. Of the two main H. pylori populations in this study, hpAsia2 strains were associated with higher activity and inflammation in the antrum compared to hpEurope strains; however, only vacA s1m1i1d1c1 strains, independent of population type, were significantly associated with inflammation in the antrum, unlike the s2m2i2d2c2 genotype. In conclusion, Bangladeshi strains were divided into two main populations of different genotypes. The low incidence of gastric cancer in Bangladesh might be attributable to the high proportion of less-virulent genotypes, which may be a better predictor of gastric cancer risk than the ancestral origin of the H. pylori strains. Finally, the vacA m region may be a better virulence marker than other regions.</abstracttext>]",[]

In particular, previous studies have shown that sucralose consumption can alter the gut microbiota. The gut microbiome plays a key role in processes related to host health, such as food digestion and fermentation, immune cell development, and enteric nervous system regulation. Inflammation is one of the most common effects associated with gut microbiome dysbiosis, which has been linked to a series of human diseases, such as diabetes and obesity. The aim of this study was to investigate the structural and functional effects of sucralose on the gut microbiota and associated inflammation in the host. In this study, C57BL/6 male mice received sucralose in their drinking water for 6 months. The difference in gut microbiota composition and metabolites between control and sucralose-treated mice was determined using 16S rRNA gene sequencing, functional gene enrichment analysis and metabolomics. Inflammatory gene expression in tissues was analyzed by RT-PCR. Alterations in bacterial genera showed that sucralose affects the gut microbiota and its developmental dynamics. Enrichment of bacterial pro-inflammatory genes and disruption in fecal metabolites suggest that 6-month sucralose consumption at the human acceptable daily intake (ADI) may increase the risk of developing tissue inflammation by disrupting the gut microbiota, which is supported by elevated pro-inflammatory gene expression in the liver of sucralose-treated mice.

The Mediator complex represents a nodal point for modulating transcription by bridging chromatin-bound transcription factors with RNA polymerase II activity; it is reversibly regulated by its cyclin-dependent kinase 8 (Cdk8) kinase submodule. Here, we identified increased Cdk8 protein expression in human failing heart explants and determined the consequence of this increase in cardiac-specific Cdk8-expressing mice. Transgenic Cdk8 overexpression resulted in progressive dilated cardiomyopathy, heart failure, and premature lethality. Prior to functional decline, left ventricular cardiomyocytes were dramatically elongated, with disorganized transverse tubules and dysfunctional calcium handling. RNA sequencing results showed that myofilament gene isoforms not typically expressed in adult cardiomyocytes were enriched, while oxidative phosphorylation and fatty acid biosynthesis genes were downregulated. Interestingly, candidate upstream transcription factor expression levels and MAPK signaling pathways thought to determine cardiomyocyte size remained relatively unaffected, suggesting that Cdk8 functions within a novel growth regulatory pathway. Our findings show that manipulating cardiac gene expression through increased Cdk8 levels is detrimental to the heart by establishing a transcriptional program that induces pathological remodeling and eccentric hypertrophy culminating in heart failure.</abstracttext>]",['https://doi.org/10.1172/jci.insight.92476']

Albeit the diagnosis of some medical Familial Hypercholesterolemia (FH) cases are due to mutations in PCSK9, APOB, or LDLR, detection of mutation rate and profiles relies heavily on different gene pools and ethnicity. We ran exome sequencing on blood genomic DNA (gDNA) from a 26-year-old Saudi patient on Ion Proton Platform (Ion Torrent, Guilford, Connecticut, USA) as part of a pilot study preluding the establishment of the Saudi Human Genome project. The sequencing results were analysed using Ion suit Bioinformatics system. The patient was matched with a lady of lean body mass and Welsh descent, who suffered from hypercholesterolemia. The first analysis of known FH genes identified five mutations in APOB, 25 mutations of known genes linked to FH, six mutations in LPR2, one mutation in LDLR, and three mutations in PCSK9. Finally, using disease filter algorithms, we filtered out more than 2000 intronic synonymous variants with likely no biological functions. No major new locus was found in FH. However, via variant reduction and TVC protocols we detected 15 new variants, among which 14 genes are linked to hypercholesterolemia, type-I, and type-II diabetes. We also detected three mutations in PCSK9 and confirmed one by Sanger. Taken together, this report suggests that the genetic determinant of FH in this Saudi patient is likely to be heterogeneous, complicating the diagnostic and novel gene discovery process.</abstracttext>]",['https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmid/28764195/']

We demonstrated that the proliferation of HSCs is critically dependent on glutamine that is used to generate Œ±-ketoglutarate (Œ±-KG) and non-essential amino acid (NEAA). In addition, both culture- and in vivo-activated HSCs have increased glutamine utilization and increased expression of genes related to glutamine metabolism, including GLS (glutaminase), aspartate transaminase (GOT1) and glutamate dehydrogenase (GLUD1). Inhibition of these enzymes, as well as glutamine depletion, had a significant inhibitory effect on HSCs activation. In addition to providing energy expenditure, conversion of glutamine to proline is enhanced. The pool of free proline may also be increased via downregulation of POX expression. Hedgehog signaling plays an important role in the regulation of glutamine metabolism, as well as TGF-Œ≤1, c-Myc, and Ras signalings, via transcriptional upregulation and repression of key metabolic enzymes in this pathway.

Perturbations in key innate immune receptors known as Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and inflammatory mediators such as IL-6, TNFŒ± and IL-1Œ≤ have been linked with T2DM. Herein, we sought to establish whether patients with T2DM and underlying complications exhibit perturbations in cytokine and TLR expression. Serum cytokine and mRNA levels of cytokines/TLRs in monocytes (M) and neutrophils (N) were measured in a cohort of 112 diabetic patients: good glycaemic control without complications (GC), good glycaemic control with complications (GCC), poor glycaemic control without complications (PC) and poor glycaemic control with complications (PCC) and compared them with 34 non-diabetic volunteers (NGT). Serum cytokine levels were normal in all study participants. In the GC group, cytokine and TLR gene expression were enhanced compared to NGT. In contrast, suppressed cytokine and TLR gene expression were evident in PC, GCC &amp; PCC groups when compared to the GC. In conclusion, whereas serum pro-inflammatory cytokine levels are unaltered in T2DM patients, differences in inflammatory gene profiles exist among the T2DM patient groups.</abstracttext>]",[]

Glucose is an important regulator of Œ≤-cell growth and function; however, the mechanisms that are involved in the chronic adaptation of Œ≤-cells to hyperglycemia remain largely unknown. In the present study, global gene expression patterns revealed that tryptophan hydroxylase 1 (<i>Tph1</i>) was the most profound of genes that are up-regulated in rat islets exposed to high glucose. Calcium and cAMP signals synergistically mediated glucose-stimulated <i>Tph1</i> transcription in Œ≤-cells by activating cAMP-responsive element-binding protein and promoting its binding with a <i>Tph1</i> promoter. Similar to <i>in vitro</i> results, <i>in vivo</i> infusion of high glucose also strongly induced <i>Tph1</i> expression and serotonin production in rat islets, along with enhanced islet function. Inhibition or knockdown of <i>Tph1</i> markedly decreased glucose-potentiated insulin secretion. In contrast, overexpression of <i>Tph1</i> augmented glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in rat islets by up-regulating the expression of genes that are related to islet function. In addition, the long-acting glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist, exendin-4, stimulated <i>Tph1</i> expression in a glucose-dependent manner. Knockdown of <i>Tph1</i> inhibited exendin-4-potentiated insulin secretion in rat islets.

Regular exercise results in an adaptive response involving changes in muscle architecture and biochemistry, and is an effective way to manage and prevent common human diseases such as obesity, cardiovascular disorders and type II diabetes.

Here we performed a transcriptome-wide analysis of skeletal muscle tissue in a large cohort of untrained Thoroughbred horses (n¬†=¬†51) before and after a bout of high-intensity exercise and again after an extended period of training. We hypothesized that regular high-intensity exercise training primes the transcriptome for the demands of high-intensity exercise.</abstracttext>, <abstracttext label=""RESULTS"" nlmcategory=""RESULTS"">An extensive set of genes was observed to be significantly differentially regulated in response to a single bout of high-intensity exercise in the untrained cohort (3241 genes) and following multiple bouts of high-intensity exercise training over a six-month period (3405 genes). Approximately one-third of these genes (1025) and several biological processes related to energy metabolism were common to both the exercise and training responses. We then developed a novel network-based computational analysis pipeline to test the hypothesis that these transcriptional changes also influence the contextual molecular interactome and its dynamics in response to exercise and training. The contextual network analysis identified several important hub genes, including the autophagosomal-related gene GABARAPL1, and dynamic functional modules, including those enriched for mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes I and V, that were differentially regulated and had their putative interactions 're-wired' in the exercise and/or training responses.</abstracttext>, <abstracttext label=""CONCLUSION"" nlmcategory=""CONCLUSIONS"">Here we have generated for the first time, a comprehensive set of genes that are differentially expressed in Thoroughbred skeletal muscle in response to both exercise and training.

Recent studies have shown that both histone modifications and DNA methylation via the de novo methyltransferase DNMT3A are involved in repression of disallowed genes in neonatal beta cells when these cells acquire their mature phenotype. It is unknown, however, if the environmental influence of advanced age, pregnancy and the metabolic stress of high fat diet or diabetes could alter the repression of disallowed genes in beta cells. In the present study, we show that islet disallowed genes-which are also deeply repressed in FACS-purified beta cells-remain deeply repressed in animals of advanced age and in pregnant females. Moreover, the stability of this repression was correlated with strong and stable histone repression marks that persisted in islets isolated from 2 year old mice and with overall high expression of Dnmt3a in islets. Furthermore, repression of disallowed genes was unaffected by the metabolic stress of high fat diet. However, repression of about half of the disallowed genes was weakened in 16 week-old diabetic db/db mice. In conclusion, we show that the disallowed status of islet genes is stable under physiological challenging conditions (advanced age, pregnancy, high fat diet) but partially lost in islets from diabetic animals.</abstracttext>]",['http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0181651']

The regional distribution of lipid deposited within adipose tissue (AT) - so called body fat distribution (BFD) - is a strong risk factor for NCDs. BFD is highly heritable; however, the genetic basis of BFD is almost entirely unknown. Genome-wide association studies have identified several loci associated with BFD, including at Plexin D1 (PLXND1) - a gene known to modulate angiogenesis. We recently demonstrated that zebrafish homozygous for a null mutation in plxnd1 had a reduced capacity to store lipid in visceral AT (VAT) leading to altered BFD. Moreover, we found that type V collagens were upregulated in plxnd1 mutants, and mediated the inhibitory effect of Plxnd1 on VAT growth. These results strengthen evidence that Plxnd1 influences BFD in human populations, and validate zebrafish as a model to study BFD. However, many pertinent questions remain unanswered.

While the associated features often occur together, the pathway(s) or mechanism(s) linking hypertension in MetS are not well understood. Previous work determined that genetic variation on rat chromosome 17 (RNO17) contributes to several MetS-defining traits (including hypertension, obesity, and dyslipidemia) in the Lyon Hypertensive (LH) rat, a genetically determined MetS model. We hypothesized that at least some of the traits on RNO17 are controlled by a single gene with pleiotropic effects. To address this hypothesis, consomic and congenic strains were developed, whereby a defined fragment of RNO17 from the LH rat was substituted with the control Lyon Normotensive (LN) rat, and MetS phenotypes were measured in the resultant progeny. Compared to LH rats, LH-17LN consomic rats have significantly reduced body weight, blood pressure, and lipid profiles. A congenic strain (LH-17LNc), with a substituted fragment at the distal end of RNO17 (17q12.3; 74-97 Mb; rn4 assembly), showed differences from the LH rat in blood pressure and serum total cholesterol and triglycerides. Interestingly, there was no difference in body weight between the LH-17LNc and the parental LH rat. These data indicate that blood pressure and serum lipids are regulated by a gene(s) in the distal congenic interval, and could be due to pleiotropy. The data also indicate that body weight is not determined by the same gene(s) at this locus. Interestingly, only two small haplotypes spanning a total of approximately 0.5 Mb differ between the LH and LN genomes in the congenic interval. Genes in these haplotypes are strong candidate genes for causing dyslipidemia in the LH rat. Overall, MetS, even in a simplified genetic model such as the LH-17LN rat, is likely due to both independent and pleiotropic gene effects.</abstracttext>]",['http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0182650']

However, GWAS only report association signals and do not necessarily identify culprit genes. As most signals occur in non-coding regions of the genome, it is often challenging to assign genomic variants to the underlying causal mechanism(s). Topologically associating domains (TADs) are primarily cell-type-independent genomic regions that define interactome boundaries and can aid in the designation of limits within which an association most likely impacts gene function. We describe and validate a computational method that uses the genic content of TADs to prioritize candidate genes. Our method, called 'TAD_Pathways', performs a Gene Ontology (GO) analysis over genes that reside within TAD boundaries corresponding to GWAS signals for a given trait or disease. Applying our pipeline to the bone mineral density (BMD) GWAS catalog, we identify 'Skeletal System Development' (Benjamini-Hochberg adjusted P=1.02x10<sup>-5</sup>) as the top-ranked pathway. In many cases, our method implicated a gene other than the nearest gene. Our molecular experiments describe a novel example: ACP2, implicated near the canonical 'ARHGAP1' locus.

It is widely used to treat several diseases, including type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, cancer, and metabolic diseases. In this study, we investigated whether AMPK activation upon treatment with metformin may promote neurite outgrowth during the progression of neuronal differentiation in human bone marrow-mesenchymal stem cells (hBM-MSCs). Differentiation of metformin-treated MSCs (Met-MSCs to Met-diMSCs) in the neuronal induction media resulted in an increase in the number of differentiated cells in a metformin concentration-dependent manner. The differentiation rate reached its maximum at 3 h after the initial treatment with neuronal induction media. At 3 h of induction, the neurite length increased significantly in Met-diMSCs as compared with control cells without metformin treatment (diMSCs). diMSCs showed a significant increase in the expression of neuronal-specific marker genes; however, the expression of dendrite-specific markers MAP-2 and Tuj-1 was significantly increased in Met-diMSCs as compared to diMSCs, as confirmed by immunoblotting. This effect was abolished upon treatment with the AMPK inhibitor, compound C, as evident by quantitative polymerase chain reaction, immunoblotting, and immunocytochemical staining.

Phenotypic heterogeneity is pronounced in PD and nonmotor symptoms dominant subtypes have been described. These endophenotypes may be underpinned by considerable nondopaminergic dysfunction; however, conventional treatment of PD continues to be mostly reliant on dopamine replacement strategy or manipulation of brain dopaminergic pathways. Consequently, treatment of many nondopaminergic nonmotor and some motor symptoms remains a key unmet need. It is also recognized that treatment strategies for PD are influenced by a number of nondrug-related issues. These include factors such as age, personality, and preferences for treatment, cultural beliefs, lifestyle, pharmacoeconomics, pharmacogenetics as well as comorbidity. Therefore, the success of clinical therapy will rest on how much these factors are considered to develop a truly holistic treatment plan. Personalized medicine is the modern way of delivering this holistic strategy for treatment of PD. Personalized medicine thus encompasses several strands of treatment. From the pharmaceutical point of view, it should involve dopaminergic and nondopaminergic strategies. In addition, there are substrategies involving precision and tailored medicine to suit the needs and requirements of individual patients. Precision medicine would be relevant for patients who may be at risk of developing the clinical syndrome of Parkinson's as identified by specific gene mutations. Precision medicine in this scenario will attempt to be preventive. Tailored medicine would address the ""single multifactorial"" complex nature of PD and address symptoms as well subtype-specific strategies.

To investigate further we compared changes in left ventricular myocardial gene expression in Type 2 diabetes to patients in a control group with left ventricular hypertrophy. 9 control patients and 7 patients with type 2 diabetes with aortic stenosis undergoing aortic valve replacement had standard ECGs, signal averaged ECGs and echocardiograms prior to surgery. During surgery, a left ventricular biopsy was taken and mRNA expression for genes relevant to the cardiac action potential were estimated by RT-PCR. Mathematical modelling of the action potential and calcium transient was undertaken using the O'Hara-Rudy model using scaled changes in gene expression. Echocardiography revealed similar values for left ventricular size, filling pressures and ejection fraction between groups. No difference was seen in positive signal averaged electrocardiograms between groups but the standard ECG demonstrated a prolonged QT interval in the diabetes group. Gene expression of ERG and Kir 3.1 were lower in the diabetes group, whereas Kir 2.1, Kir3.4 and NCX1 expression were higher. Modelling suggested these changes would lead to prolongation of the action potential duration with generation of early after-depolarisations secondary to a reduction in density of the I<sub>K, r</sub> current (rapid delayed rectifier K<sup>+</sup> current) and increased I<sub>Na/Ca</sub> current (Na<sup>+</sup> -Ca<sup>2+</sup> calcium exchange current).

The disease is caused by loss-of-function mutations in either of the two genes <i>EPM2A</i> (laforin) or <i>EPM2B</i> (malin). It characteristically involves the accumulation of insoluble glycogen-derived particles, named Lafora bodies (LBs), which are considered neurotoxic and causative of the disease. The pathogenesis of LD is therefore centred on the question of how insoluble LBs emerge from soluble glycogen. Recent data clearly show that an abnormal glycogen chain length distribution, but neither hyperphosphorylation nor impairment of general autophagy, strictly correlates with glycogen accumulation and the presence of LBs. This review summarizes results obtained with patients, mouse models, and cell lines and consolidates apparent paradoxes in the LD literature. Based on the growing body of evidence, it proposes that LD is predominantly caused by an impairment in chain-length regulation affecting only a small proportion of the cellular glycogen. A better grasp of LD pathogenesis will further develop our understanding of glycogen metabolism and structure. It will also facilitate the development of clinical interventions that appropriately target the underlying cause of LD.</abstracttext>]",['http://www.mdpi.com/resolver?pii=ijms18081743']

The glucose, urea, uric acid, and creatinine levels were measured in sera using colorimetric methods. To determine the oxidative stress condition in the kidney tissues, total antioxidant capacity (TAC), malondialdehyde (MDA), and total oxidant status (TOS) were measured using colorimetric methods. Inflammation status was evaluated by the determination of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-Œ±) gene and protein expression using qRT-PCR and ELISA respectively, while nitric oxide (NO) level in these tissues was measured using the Griess method. Histological examination of Kidneys was carried out by H&amp;E staining. The levels of glucose, urea, and uric acid were found to increase in the serum of diabetic rats and decrease in that of diabetic rats after treatment with garlic. Measurement of MDA, TOS, and TAC revealed oxidative stress in diabetic rats, which improved after receiving the extract. The NO and TNF-Œ± protein levels in diabetic rats were higher than those in control rats. After treatment with garlic, the levels of TNF-Œ± protein and NO became close to the normal levels. Histological results confirmed certain other data as well. Garlic has antioxidant properties; therefore, it can reduce oxidative stress, which plays an important role in the development of diabetic nephropathy. Reduction in oxidative stress has beneficial effects on inflammation because it leads to a decrease in the level of TNF-Œ±.</abstracttext>]",[]

Hence, there has been a focus on increasing energy expenditure in aged populations to protect them from age-associated diseases. Dihydrocapsiate (DCT) is a compound that belongs to the capsinoid family. Capsinoids are capsaicin analogs that are found in non-pungent peppers and increase whole-body energy expenditure. However, their effect on energy expenditure has been reported only in young populations, and to date the effectiveness of DCT in increasing energy expenditure in aged populations has not been investigated. In this study, we investigated whether DCT supplementation in aged mice improves age-associated impairments.

After 12 weeks of supplementation, blood and tissue samples were collected and analyzed. DCT significantly suppressed age-associated fat accumulation, adipocyte hypertrophy, and liver steatosis. In addition, the DCT treatment dramatically suppressed age-associated increases in hepatic inflammation, immune cell infiltration, and oxidative stress. DCT exerted these suppression effects by increasing energy expenditure linked to upregulation of both the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) gene program and fatty acid oxidation in skeletal muscle. These results indicate that DCT efficiently improves age-associated impairments, including liver steatosis and inflammation, in part by increasing energy expenditure via activation of the fat oxidation pathway in skeletal muscle.</abstracttext>]",[]

AMIA Joint Summits on Translational Science,"[<abstracttext>Electronic health records (EHRs) linked with biobanks have been recognized as valuable data sources for pharmacogenomic studies, which require identification of patients with certain adverse drug reactions (ADRs) from a large population. Since manual chart review is costly and time-consuming, automatic methods to accurately identify patients with ADRs have been called for. In this study, we developed and compared different informatics approaches to identify ADRs from EHRs, using clopidogrel-induced bleeding as our case study. Three different types of methods were investigated: 1) rule-based methods; 2) machine learning-based methods; and 3) scoring function-based methods. Our results show that both machine learning and scoring methods are effective and the scoring method can achieve a high precision with a reasonable recall. We also analyzed the contributions of different types of features and found that the temporality information between clopidogrel and bleeding events, as well as textual evidence from physicians' assertion of the adverse events are helpful. We believe that our findings are valuable in advancing EHR-based pharmacogenomic studies.</abstracttext>]",[]

Amongst these, there were 3 lncRNAs that were significantly downregulated and H19 was the most altered lncRNA in the livers of db/db mice. H19 expression significantly correlated with the expression of genes of the glycolysis and gluconeogenesis pathways, which suggest that altered hepatic H19 levels can directly or indirectly modulate their expression. Inhibition of H19 using specific siRNA in HepG2 cells and primary mouse hepatocytes significantly increased the levels of gluconeogenic genes. This was subsequently accompanied by increased hepatic glucose output. Further,H19 depletion in HepG2 cells impaired insulin signaling and increased nuclear localization of FoxO1, an important transcriptional regulator of gluconeogenic gene expression. Our results reveal a novel link between decreased H19 levels and impaired gluconeogenesis via regulation of FoxO1 nuclear levels.

First-generation triplet-primed PCR assays allow these interruptions to be detected. However, since the triplet primer used has multiple binding sites in the repeat tract, interpreting the results is not straightforward and it is not always possible to unambiguously determine the AGG-interruption status in females because of the difficulties associated with the presence of a second X chromosome.

Additionally, adjusted odds ratio showed an increased risk in dominant √ó dominant (4.15-fold [1.40 - 12.26]; 95% CI; p = 0.01) and dominant √ó recessive (2.18-fold [1.14 - 4.16; 95% CI; p = 0.02) genotype combinations of the two polymorphisms.

However, challenges associated with the isolation of pure MSC populations, their culture and expansion, specific phenotypic characterization, multi-potential differentiation and challenges of efficient transplantation limit their usage. The current strategies of cell-based therapies emphasize introducing beneficial genes, which will improve the therapeutic ability of MSCs and have better homing efficiency. The continuous improvement in gene transfer technologies has broad implications in stem cell biology. Although viral vectors are efficient vehicles for gene delivery, construction of viral vectors with desired genes, their safety and immunogenicity limit their use in clinical applications. We review current gene delivery approaches, including viral and plasmid vectors, for transfecting MSC with beneficial genes. The review also discusses the use of a few emerging technologies that could be used to improve the transfer/induction of desirable genes for cell therapy.</abstracttext>]",[]

By implication, such epigenetic changes are non-genetically determined, although they can be affected by inherited genetic variation. Extensive evidence indicates that autoimmune diseases including type 1 diabetes are determined by the interaction of genetic and non-genetic factors. Much is known of the genetic causes of these diseases, but the non-genetic effects are less clear-cut. Further, it remains unclear how they interact to cause the destructive autoimmune process. This review identifies the key issues in the genetic/non-genetic interaction, examining the most recent evidence of the role of non-genetic effects in the disease process, including the impact of epigenetic effects on key pathways.</abstracttext>, <abstracttext label=""RECENT FINDINGS"" nlmcategory=""RESULTS"">Recent research indicates that these pathways likely involve immune effector cells both of the innate and adaptive immune response.

ORMDL3 is localized to the endoplasmic reticulum and regulates downstream pathways including sphingolipids, metalloproteases, remodeling genes, and chemokines. ORMDL3 inhibits serine palmitoyl-CoA transferase, the rate-limiting enzyme for sphingolipid biosynthesis. In addition, ORMDL3 activates the ATF6Œ± branch of the unfolded protein response which regulates SERCA2b and IL-6, pathways of potential importance to asthma. The SNP-linking chromosome 17q21 to asthma is associated with increased ORMDL3 and GSDMB expression. Mice expressing either increased levels of human ORMDL3, or human GSDMB, have an asthma phenotype characterized by increased airway responsiveness and increased airway remodeling (increased smooth muscle and fibrosis) in the absence of airway inflammation. GSDMB regulates expression of 5-LO and TGF-Œ≤1 which are known pathways involved in the pathogenesis of asthma. GSDMB is one of four members of the GSDM family (GSDMA, GSDMB, GSDMC, and GSDMD). GSDMD (located on chromosome 8q24 and not linked to asthma) has emerged as a key mediator of pyroptosis. GSDMD is a key component of the NLPR3 inflammasome and is required for its activation. GSDMD undergoes proteolytic cleavage by caspase-1 to release its N-terminal fragment, which in turn mediates pyroptosis and IL-1Œ≤ secretion.

Composite end points are a pragmatic necessity in CVOTs to ensure that sample size and duration of follow-up remain reasonable. Combining clinical outcomes into a composite end point increases the numbers of events ascertained and thus statistical power and precision. Historically, composite CV end points in diabetes trials have included a larger number of components, while more recent CVOTs almost exclusively use a composite of CV death, nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI), and nonfatal stroke-the so-called three-point major adverse CV event (3P-MACE) composite-or add hospitalization for unstable angina (HUA) to these three outcomes (4P-MACE). The inclusion of HUA increases the number of events for analysis, but noteworthy disadvantages include clinical subjectivity in ascertainment of HUA and its lower prognostic relevance compared with CV death, MI, or stroke. Furthermore, results from recent CVOTs indicate that glucose-lowering agents seem to have minimal impact on HUA. Its inclusion therefore potentially favors a shift of the hazard ratio (HR) toward the null, which is especially problematic in trials designed to demonstrate noninferiority. The primary outcome of 3P-MACE may offer a better balance than 4P-MACE between statistical efficiency, operational complexity, the likelihood of diagnostic precision (and therefore clinical relevance) for each of the component outcomes, clinical importance, and the aim to adequately capture any potential treatment effect of the intervention. Nevertheless, as individual medications may mechanistically differ in their impact on CV outcomes, no particular individual or composite end point can be seen as a ""gold standard"" for CVOTs of all glucose-lowering drugs.</abstracttext>]",[]

Phenologs have been widely observed and accepted by those who study model organisms, and allow one to study a set of genes in a model organism to learn more about the function of those genes in other organisms, including humans. At the cellular and molecular level, these conserved genes likely function in a very similar mode, but are doing so in different tissues or cell types and can result in different phenotypic effects. For example, the RAS-RAF-MEK-MAPK pathway in animals is a highly conserved signaling pathway that animals adopted for numerous biological processes, such as vulval induction in Caenorhabditis elegans and cell proliferation in mammalian cells; but, this same gene set has been co-opted to function in a variety of cellular contexts. In this review, I will give a few examples of how suppressor screens in model organisms (with a emphasis on C. elegans) can identify new genes that function in a conserved pathway in many other organisms. I will also demonstrate how the identification of such genes can lead to important insights into mammalian biology. From such screens, an occasional silent suppressor that does not cause a phenotype on its own is found; such suppressors thus make for good candidates as therapeutic targets.

Part C, Seminars in medical genetics","[<abstracttext>More than a century ago, Wilhelm Johannsen proposed the terms ""genotype"" and ""phenotype"" to study heredity. Much of what we know about genetics and behavior has evolved since then, especially how causality from genotypes can be inferred from observational studies of phenotypes. Unfortunately, there are genotypes that produce complex clinical-behavioral phenotypes-pleiotropy. In addition, there are often many genotypes that produce the same phenotype, adding a layer of complexity in establishing valid genotype-phenotype relationships. Unlike the relative simplicity of some phenotypes, behavioral phenotypes, especially those characteristics considered aberrant, are multidimensional and often not easily defined operationally. An alternate approach which attempts to identify less evident manifestations below the level of the phenotype but along the pathway to the prospective genotype-endophenotypes-could prove useful in detecting genes that generate these markers. However, operational definitions of intermediate phenotypes vary, less overt neurobiological expressions for some disorders-autism-have not been found, and studies of endophenotypes associated with schizophrenia have been not been very successful. Another approach, suggested by Sewall Wright, uses path analysis to identify causal variables that produce phenotypes. Innovative models of causality have been developed recently by genetic epidemiologists that incorporate Mendel's second law, and Mendelian randomization has been successful in identifying genotypes associated with some diseases, for example, diabetes and cancer. Regrettably, shortcomings regarding genetic markers associated with intermediate phenotypes have been found, although there are statistical procedures to remedy matters. As in any science, genetic researchers need to consider carefully the models of causality they choose.</abstracttext>]",[]

NIFTPs exhibit a behavior that is very close to that of follicular adenomas but different from the infiltrative and invasive follicular variants of papillary thyroid carcinomas (FVPTCs). The importance of miRNAs to carcinogenesis has been reported in recent years. miRNAs seem to be promising diagnostic and prognostic molecular markers for thyroid cancer, and the combination of miRNA expression and mutational status might improve cytological diagnosis. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the miRNA expression profile in wild-type, <i>RAS</i><i>-</i> or <i>BRAF</i>-mutated NIFTPs, infiltrative and invasive FVPTCs, and follicular adenomas using the nCounter miRNA Expression assay (NanoString Technologies). To identify the significant Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) molecular pathways associated with deregulated miRNAs, we used the union of pathways option in DNA Intelligent Analysis (DIANA) miRPath software. We have shown that the miRNA expression profiles of wild-type and mutated NIFTPs could be different. The expression profile of wild-type NIFTPs seems comparable to that of follicular adenomas, whereas mutated NIFTPs have an expression profile similar to that of infiltrative and invasive FVPTCs. The upregulation of 4 miRNAs (miR-221-5p, miR-221-3p, miR-222-3p, miR-146b-5p) and the downregulation of 8 miRNAs (miR-181a-3p, miR-28-5p, miR-363-3p, miR-342-3p, miR-1285-5p, miR-152-3p, miR-25-3p, miR-30e-3) in mutated NIFTPs compared to wild-type ones suggest a potential invasive-like phenotype by deregulating the specific pathways involved in cell adhesion and cell migration (Hippo signaling pathway, ECM-receptor interaction, adherens junction, regulation of actin cytoskeleton, fatty acid biosynthesis and metabolism).</abstracttext>]",[]

The atheroma growth leads to vessel hardening and lumen narrowing, limiting the blood flow. The atheroma plaque can eventually break, expose highly thrombogenic material and lead to platelet activation and subsequent formation of a thrombus that may block blood flow in loco, or even leading to obstruction of other vessels with a smaller diameter. This process is one of the main determinants of the clinical manifestations of atherosclerosis, such as coronary artery disease, ischemic stroke, and peripheral arterial disease. Although the inflammatory theory about atherosclerosis is the most renowned one, observations point to common biological characteristics between cancer and atherosclerosis suggesting a possible association between p53 and atherosclerotic diseases. We collected peripheral blood samples from 200 individuals with clinical manifestations of atherosclerotic disease and 100 individuals without manisfestation of the disease to form the control group. DNA was subjected to molecular analysis (PCR) to identify the polymorphism of the p53 gene. We have not found any relationship between the polymorphism of the p53 gene and atherosclerosis in the population studied (P = 0.36). There was no relationship between atherosclerosis, polymorphism of p53 and the variables accounted: smoking habit (P = 0.72, 0.51 and 0.62 for smokers, non-smokers and former smokers respectively), alcohol consumption (P = 0.17 for individuals with drinking habits and 0.38 for those who do not consume alcohol beverage), systemic arterial hypertension (P = 0.60), diabetes mellitus (P = 0.34), and dyslipidemia (P = 0.89). Our population has a high rate of miscegenation and heterozygotes, and according to studies the arginine variant is more related to plaque formation because it induces apoptosis more frequently when compared to the proline variant. According to our results, there is no association between the polymorphism of the p53 gene, atherosclerosis and its risk factors in the population studied.</abstracttext>]",[]

The disease, as with other autoimmune diseases, is due to the interaction of genetic and non-genetic effects, which induce a destructive process damaging insulin-secreting cells. In this review, we focus on the nature of this interaction, and how our understanding of that gene-environment interaction has changed our understanding of the nature of the disease. We discuss the early onset of the disease, the development of distinct immunogenotypes, and the declining heritability with increasing age at diagnosis. Whilst Human Leukocyte Antigens (HLA) have a major role in causing T1D, we note that some of these HLA genes have a protective role, especially in children, whilst other non-HLA genes are also important. In adult-onset T1D, the disease is often not insulin-dependent at diagnosis, and has a dissimilar immunogenotype with reduced genetic predisposition. Finally, we discuss the putative nature of the non-genetic factors and how they might interact with genetic susceptibility, including preliminary studies of the epigenome associated with T1D.</abstracttext>]",['http://www.mdpi.com/resolver?pii=genes8080209']

In the past, the majority of the genomic sequence has been considered transcriptionally silent, but recent large-scale studies have uncovered an array of functionally significant elements, including non-protein-coding transcripts, within these noncoding regions of the human genome. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), a class of noncoding transcripts with lengths &gt;200 nucleotides, are pervasively transcribed in the genome and function as signals, decoys, guides, or scaffolds to regulate gene expression. More than 200 diseases have been associated with dysregulated or dysfunctional lncRNAs, and new associations continue to accumulate in the literature. The role of lncRNAs in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes mellitus and related complications has only recently been recognized, but there is already evidence for their involvement in many of the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the disease. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge of the functions and underlying mechanisms of lncRNA activity with a focus on type 2 diabetes mellitus and related renal and retinal complications of the disease. We also discuss the potential of lncRNAs to serve as therapeutic targets for drug development and diagnostic markers for clinical applications in the management of diabetes.</abstracttext>]",['http://www.mdpi.com/resolver?pii=genes8080207']

Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are an appealing vehicle for safe and convenient oral delivery of bioactive peptide and protein drugs. Exendin-4 (Exd4) is a glucagon-like protein-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist that is considered an excellent therapeutic peptide drug for type 2 diabetes due to its longer-lasting bioactivity, resulting from resistance to dipeptidyl peptidase 4. We explored Lactococcus lactis with the nisin-controlled gene expression (NICE) system as an oral delivery system for recombinant (r) Exd4 peptide in situ. Heterologous expression and secretion of rExd4 by L. lactis NZ9000/pNZ8048-rExd4 were successful and efficient under the NICE system. In vitro treatment with rExd4 significantly enhanced insulin secretion of INS-1 cells and activated the PI3-K/AKT signal pathway with protein levels of AKT and p-AKT increasing 1.6- to 1.8-fold compared to negative controls, similar to the positive GLP-1 controls. INS-1 cells treated with rExd4 also showed enhanced proliferation and inhibited apoptosis, corresponding with the effects of the standard Exd4 and GLP-1 treatments. Our data suggest that the rExd4 secreted by L. lactis is a bioactive insulinotropic peptide and functional GLP-1 receptor agonist that enhances glucose-dependent insulin secretion and activates the PI3-K/AKT signal pathway; furthermore, it may be involved in improving proliferation and inhibiting apoptosis of INS-1 cells in in vitro treatments. Therefore, L. lactis producing rExd4 may potentially serve as a novel strategy for oral treatment of diabetes.</abstracttext>]",['https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00253-017-8410-6']

However, the information on polymorphism's potential modifying effect on obesity- and metabolic-related traits achieved through training is still unknown. Therefore, we decided to check if selected body measurements observed in physically active participants would be modulated by the genotype. The genotype distribution was examined in a group of 201 Polish women measured for chosen traits before and after the completion of a 12 week moderate-intensive aerobic training program. A statistically significant relationship between the glucose level and the genotype was identified (p = 0.046). Participants with CC and CT genotypes had a higher glucose level during the entire study period compared with the TT genotype. However, our results did not confirm the relationship between the C allele and an increased BMI or other obesity-related traits. Additionally, we did not observe a near MC4R C/T polymorphism x physical activity interaction. However, our results revealed that majority of obesity-related variables changed significantly during the 12 week training program. The effect sizes (d) of these changes ranged from small to medium (d = 0.11-0.80), whereas the largest effect (d = 0.80; i.e. medium) was reported for the fat mass content (FM). We found a relationship between the near MC4R C/T polymorphism and an increased glucose level, and it is thus a candidate to influence type 2 diabetes. Interestingly, after the 12 week training program, participants with the C (risk) allele with fasting hyperglycemia had a normal glucose level. Although, this change was not statistically significant, it shows an important trend which needs further investigation.</abstracttext>]",[]

Increasing evidence supports an important role of metabolites as well as macro- and micronutrients in brown adipocyte differentiation and function. Calcium is one of the most abundant ions in the body regulating multiple cellular processes. We observed that increasing extracellular calcium concentration during brown adipocyte differentiation blocks lipid accumulation and suppresses induction of major adipogenic transcription factors such as PPARŒ≥ and C/EBPŒ±. In contrast, the depletion of calcium in the medium enhances adipogenesis and expression of brown adipocyte selective genes, such as UCP1. Mechanistically, we show that elevated extracellular calcium inhibits C/EBPŒ≤ activity through hyperactivation of ERK, a process that is independent of intracellular calcium levels and reversibly halts differentiation. Moreover, increased extracellular calcium solely after the induction phase of differentiation specifically suppresses gene expression of UCP1, PRDM16 and PGC1-Œ±. Notably, depleting extracellular calcium provokes opposite effects. Together, we show that modulating extracellular calcium concentration controls brown adipocyte differentiation and thermogenic gene expression, highlighting the importance of tissue microenvironment on brown adipocyte heterogeneity and function.</abstracttext>]",['http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-017-09025-3']

Pro-inflammatory including TNF-Œ±, IFN-Œ≥ and IL-1Œ≤ are released in the islet during the autoimmune assault and signal in Œ≤-cells through phosphorylation cascades, resulting in pro-apoptotic gene expression and eventually Œ≤-cell death. Protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) are a family of enzymes that regulate phosphorylative signalling, and are associated with the development of T1D. Here, we observed expression of PTPN6 and PTPN1 in human islets and islets from non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice. To clarify the role of these PTPs in Œ≤-cells/islets, we took advantage of CRISPR/Cas9 technology and pharmacological approaches to inactivate both proteins. We identify PTPN6 as a negative regulator of TNF-Œ±-induced Œ≤-cell death, through JNK-dependent BCL-2 protein degradation. In contrast, PTPN1 acts as a positive regulator of IFN-Œ≥-induced STAT1-dependent gene expression, which enhanced autoimmune destruction of Œ≤-cells. Importantly, PTPN1 inactivation by pharmacological modulation protects Œ≤-cells and primary mouse islets from cytokine-mediated cell death. Thus, our data point to a non-redundant effect of PTP regulation of cytokine signalling in Œ≤-cells in autoimmune diabetes.</abstracttext>]",[]
"Sim√£o F, Feener EP.",2017,28824910,The Effects of the Contact Activation System on Hemorrhage.,Frontiers in medicine,"[<abstracttext>The contact activation system (CAS) exerts effects on coagulation <i>via</i> multiple mechanisms, which modulate both the intrinsic and extrinsic coagulation cascades as well as fibrinolysis and platelet activation. While the effects of the CAS on blood coagulation measured as activated partial thromboplastin time shortening are well documented, genetic mutations that result in deficiencies in the expression of either plasma prekallikrein (PPK) or factor XII (FXII) are not associated with spontaneous bleeding or increased bleeding risk during surgery. Deficiencies in these proteins are often undiagnosed for decades and detected later in life during routine coagulation assays without an apparent clinical phenotype. Increased interest in the CAS as a potentially safe target for antithrombotic therapies has emerged, in large part, from studies on animal models with provoked thrombosis, which have shown that deficiencies in PPK or FXII can reduce thrombus formation without increasing bleeding. Gene targeting and pharmacological studies in healthy animals have confirmed that PPK and FXII blockade does not cause coagulopathies. These findings support the conclusion that CAS is not required for hemostasis. However, while deficiencies in FXII and PPK do not significantly affect bleeding associated with peripheral wounds, recent reports have demonstrated that these proteins can promote hemorrhage in the retina and brain. Intravitreal injection of plasma kallikrein (PKal) induces retinal hemorrhage and intracerebral injection of PKal increases intracranial bleeding. PPK deficiency and PKal inhibition ameliorates hematoma formation following cerebrovascular injury in diabetic animals. Moreover, both PPK and FXII deficiency are protective against intracerebral hemorrhage caused by tissue plasminogen activator-mediated thrombolytic therapy in mice with thrombotic middle cerebral artery occlusion. Thus, while the CAS is not required for hemostasis, its inhibition may provide an opportunity to reduce hemorrhage in the retina and brain. Characterization of the mechanisms and potential clinical implications associated with the effects of the CAS on hemorrhage requires further consideration of the effects of PPK and FXII on hemorrhage beyond their putative effects on coagulation cascades. Here, we review the experimental and clinical evidence on the effects of the CAS on bleeding and hemostatic mechanisms.</abstracttext>]",['https://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmed.2017.00121']

Macrophages are amongst the first immune cells to respond to bacteria and their products, so we sought to directly compare the response of macrophages to <i>P. gingivalis</i> or its purified OMVs. Macrophages stimulated with OMVs produced large amounts of TNFŒ±, IL-12p70, IL-6, IL-10, IFNŒ≤, and nitric oxide compared to cells infected with <i>P. gingivalis</i>, which produced very low levels of these mediators. Both <i>P. gingivalis</i> and OMVs induced a shift in macrophage metabolism from oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) to glycolysis, which was supported by enhanced lactate release, decreased mitochondrial oxygen consumption with reduced spare respiratory capacity, as well as increased mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Corresponding to this metabolic shift, gene expression analysis of macrophages infected with <i>P. gingivalis</i> or stimulated with OMVs revealed a broad transcriptional upregulation of genes critical to glycolysis and a downregulation of genes associated with the TCA cycle. Upon examination of inflammasome signaling and pyroptosis it was found that <i>P. gingivalis</i> did not activate the inflammasome in macrophages as the mature forms of caspase-1, IL-1Œ≤, and IL-18 were not detected and there was no extracellular release of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) or 7-AAD staining. In comparison, macrophages stimulated with OMVs potently activated caspase-1, produced large amounts of IL-1Œ≤, IL-18, released LDH, and were positive for 7-AAD indicative of pyroptotic cell death.
