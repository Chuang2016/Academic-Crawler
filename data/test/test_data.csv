Yet, the weak and narrow absorption of lanthanide ions poses a fundamental limit of UCNPs to withhold their brightness, creating a long-standing hurdle for the field. Dye-sensitized UCNPs are emerging to address this performance-limiting problem, yielding up to thousands-fold brighter luminescence than conventional UCNPs without dye sensitization. In their configuration, organic dyes with spectrally broad and intense absorption are anchored to the surface of UCNPs to harvest the excitation light energy, which is then transferred via Förster and/or Dexter mechanisms across the organic/inorganic interface to the lanthanides incorporated in UCNPs (with or devoid of a shell) to empower efficient upconversion. This tutorial review highlights recent progress in the development of dye sensitized UCNPs, with an emphasis on the theory of energy transfer, the geometric classification of the dye sensitized core and core/shell nanocrystals, and their emerging photonic and biophotonic applications. Opportunities and challenges offered by dye sensitized UCNPs are also discussed.</abstracttext>]",['http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c7cs00053g']

The prevalence of PAD is higher in patients receiving haemodialysis therapy. For early assessment of arterial occlusion using bilateral photoplethysmography (PPG), such as changes in pulse transit time and pulse shape, bilateral timing differences could be used to identify the risk level of PAD. Hence, the authors propose a discrete fractional-order integrator to calculate the bilateral area under the systolic peak (AUSP). These indices indicated the differences in both rise-timing and amplitudes of PPG signals. The dexter and sinister AUSP ratios were preliminarily used to separate the normal condition from low/high risk of PAD. Then, transition probability-based decision-making model was employed to evaluate the risk levels. The joint probability could be specified as a critical threshold, &lt; 0.81, to identify the true positive for screening low or high risk level of PAD, referring to the patients' health records. In contrast to the bilateral timing differences and traditional methods, the proposed model showed better efficiency in PAD assessments and provided a promising strategy to be implemented in an embedded system.</abstracttext>]",[]

The achievable concentration of ribavirin within hepatocytes is likely to be an important determinant of therapeutic outcome. In vitro expression levels of equilibrative nucleoside transporter 1 (ENT1) has been shown to be a predictor of treatment response in patients receiving nucleoside-based chemotherapeutic agents. We therefore investigated whether a similar relationship existed between ENT1 expression and ribavirin uptake in freshly isolated primary hepatocytes. Methods Primary hepatocytes were cultured on collagen-coated plates and exposed to ribavirin. Parallel samples were taken for high-performance liquid chromatography to assess ribavirin uptake and for quantitative polymerase chain reaction to evaluate ENT1 expression. Similar assays were performed on the human hepatoma cell line (Huh7). ENT1 gene sequence was analysed by cloning of polymerase chain reaction amplified complementary DNA followed by direct sequencing. Results There was a strong direct correlation between expression of ENT1 in primary hepatocytes and ribavirin uptake at 24 hr. Huh7 cells expressed ENT1 at similar levels to the majority of primary hepatocytes, but did not take up ribavirin. Sequencing revealed that ENT1 in Huh7 cells is wild type. Conclusions In this study, we clearly demonstrate that ribavirin uptake in primary human hepatocytes is variable and correlates with ENT1 expression. This variation in ENT1 expression may account for differences in response rate in patients receiving ribavirin-based anti-hepatitis C virus therapy.</abstracttext>]",['http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/2040206616686894?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&rfr_dat=cr_pub%3dpubmed']

However, there is a paucity in studies examining the effect of AgNP on the resident immune cells of the brain, microglia. Given microglia are implicated in neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's disease (PD), it is important to examine how AgNPs affect microglial inflammation to fully assess AgNP neurotoxicity. In addition, understanding AgNP processing by microglia will allow better prediction of their long term bioreactivity. In the present study, the in vitro uptake and intracellular transformation of citrate-capped AgNPs by microglia, as well as their effects on microglial inflammation and related neurotoxicity were examined. Analytical microscopy demonstrated internalization and dissolution of AgNPs within microglia and formation of non-reactive silver sulphide (Ag<sub>2</sub>S) on the surface of AgNPs. Furthermore, AgNP-treatment up-regulated microglial expression of the hydrogen sulphide (H<sub>2</sub>S)-synthesizing enzyme cystathionine-γ-lyase (CSE). In addition, AgNPs showed significant anti-inflammatory effects, reducing lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated ROS, nitric oxide and TNFα production, which translated into reduced microglial toxicity towards dopaminergic neurons. Hence, the present results indicate that intracellular Ag<sub>2</sub>S formation, resulting from CSE-mediated H<sub>2</sub>S production in microglia, sequesters Ag<sup>+</sup> ions released from AgNPs, significantly limiting their toxicity, concomitantly reducing microglial inflammation and related neurotoxicity.</abstracttext>]","['http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/srep42871', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmid/28251989/']"

The cause of ADHD and PD remains unknown, but there is increasing evidence that both seem to result from a complicated interplay of genetic and environmental factors affecting numerous cellular processes and brain regions. To explore the possibility of common genetic pathways within the respective pathophysiologies, nine ADHD candidate single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in seven genes were tested for association with PD in 5333 cases and 12,019 healthy controls: one variant, respectively, in the genes coding for synaptosomal-associated protein 25 k (SNAP25), the dopamine (DA) transporter (SLC6A3; DAT1), DA receptor D4 (DRD4), serotonin receptor 1B (HTR1B), tryptophan hydroxylase 2 (TPH2), the norepinephrine transporter SLC6A2 and three SNPs in cadherin 13 (CDH13). Information was extracted from a recent meta-analysis of five genome-wide association studies, in which 7,689,524 SNPs in European samples were successfully imputed. No significant association was observed after correction for multiple testing. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that candidate variants implicated in the pathogenesis of ADHD do not play a substantial role in PD.</abstracttext>]",['https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12402-017-0219-8']

During dialysis, when blood flow decreases, it may retrograde from the peripheral artery through the palmar arch to the arterial anastomosis site. Arterial steal syndrome (ASS) causes distal hypoperfusion, resulting in hand ischemia or extremity pain and edema. Hence, this study proposes the bilateral photoplethysmography (PPG) for ASS detection in arteriovenous fistulas. The decision-making quantizer utilizes the fractional-order feature extraction method and a non-cooperative game (NCG) framework to evaluate the ASS risk level. Bilateral asynchronous PPG signals have significant differences in the rise time and amplitude in relation to the degree of stenosis. The fractional-order self-synchronization error formulation is a feature extraction method used to quantify bilateral differences in blood flow changes between the dexter and sinister PPG signals. The NCG model as a method of decision-making is then employed to evaluate the ASS risk level. Using an acoustic Doppler measurement, the resistive (Res) index is also used to evaluate the vascular access stenosis at the arterial anastomosis site. In contrast with alternative methods including the high-sensitivity C-reactive protein level or Res index, our experimental results indicate that the proposed decision-making quantizer is more efficient in preventing ASS during hemodialysis treatment.</abstracttext>]",['https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11517-016-1503-z']

MWNTs with different degrees of acid oxidation may have different bioreactivities and propensities to aggregate in the extracellular environment, and both individualised and aggregated MWNTs may be expected to be found in the brain. Before practical application, it is vital to understand how both aggregates and individual MWNTs will interact with local phagocytic immune cells, the microglia, and ultimately to determine their biopersistence in the brain. The processing of extra- and intracellular MWNTs (both pristine and when acid oxidised) by microglia was characterised across multiple length scales by correlating a range of dynamic, quantitative and multi-scale techniques, including: UV-vis spectroscopy, light microscopy, focussed ion beam scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. Dynamic, live cell imaging revealed the ability of microglia to break apart and internalise micron-sized extracellular agglomerates of acid oxidised MWNTs, but not pristine MWNTs. The total amount of MWNTs internalised by, or strongly bound to, microglia was quantified as a function of time. Neither the significant uptake of oxidised MWNTs, nor the incomplete uptake of pristine MWNTs affected microglial viability, pro-inflammatory cytokine release or nitric oxide production. However, after 24 h exposure to pristine MWNTs, a significant increase in the production of reactive oxygen species was observed. Small aggregates and individualised oxidised MWNTs were present in the cytoplasm and vesicles, including within multilaminar bodies, after 72 h. Some evidence of morphological damage to oxidised MWNT structure was observed including highly disordered graphitic structures, suggesting possible biodegradation. This work demonstrates the utility of dynamic, quantitative and multi-scale techniques in understanding the different cellular processing routes of functionalised nanomaterials.

We identify genetic risk profiles based on GWAS variants associated with schizophrenia and Crohn's disease as significantly associated with risk of PD. Conditional analyses adjusting for SNPs near loci associated with PD and schizophrenia or PD and Crohn's disease suggest that spatially overlapping loci associated with schizophrenia and PD account for most of the shared comorbidity, while variation outside of known proximal loci shared by PD and Crohn's disease accounts for their shared genetic comorbidity. We examine brain methylation and expression signatures proximal to schizophrenia and Crohn's disease loci to infer functional changes in the brain associated with the variants contributing to genetic comorbidity. We compare our results with a systematic review of epidemiological literature, while the findings are dissimilar to a degree; marginal genetic associations corroborate the directionality of associations across genetic and epidemiological data.

The activity of MASP-1 in the peripheral blood has been identified previously as a highly significant predictor of the severity of liver fibrosis in hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, but not in liver disease of other aetiologies. In this study we tested the hypotheses that expression of MASP-1 may promote disease progression in HCV disease by direct activation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) and may additionally be up-regulated by HCV. In order to do so, we utilized a model for the maintenance of primary human HSC in the quiescent state by culture on basement membrane substrate prior to stimulation. In comparison to controls, recombinant MASP-1 stimulated quiescent human HSCs to differentiate to the activated state as assessed by both morphology and up-regulation of HSC activation markers α-smooth muscle actin and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1. Further, the expression of MASP-1 was up-regulated significantly by HCV infection in hepatocyte cell lines. These observations suggest a new role for MASP-1 and provide a possible mechanistic link between high levels of MASP-1 and the severity of disease in HCV infection. Taken together with previous clinical observations, our new findings suggest that the balance of MASP-1 activity may be proinflammatory and act to accelerate fibrosis progression in HCV liver disease. </abstracttext>]","['http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/cei.12174', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmid/23841802/']"

The multivariate analysis of the AAO was a mixed linear model, with COMT genotype and gender considered as fixed effects and cohort and cohort-gender interaction as random effects. COMT genotype was coded as a quantitative variable, assuming a codominant genetic effect. The distribution of the COMT polymorphism was not significantly different in patients and controls (p=0.22).

Analysing two independent GWA studies, we identified that both had a significant excess in the number of functional categories enriched for PD-associated genes (minimum P = 0.014 and P = 0.006, respectively). Moreover, 58 categories were significantly enriched for associated genes in both GWA studies (P &lt; 0.001), implicating genes involved in the 'regulation of leucocyte/lymphocyte activity' and also 'cytokine-mediated signalling' as conferring an increased susceptibility to PD. These results were unaltered by the exclusion of all 178 genes that were present at the 18 genomic regions previously reported to be strongly associated with PD (including the HLA locus).

We found that an effective shielding of triplet energy transfer from a high E(T) phosphor guest to a low E(T) polymer host is possible upon introducing dense side chains to the polymer to block direct contact from the guest such that the possibility of Dexter energy transfer between them is reduced to a minimum. Together with energy level matching to allow charge trapping on the guest, high device efficiency can be achieved. The extent of shielding for the systems of phenylene-based conjugated structures from iridium complexes follows the sequence di-substituted (octoxyl chain) in the para position (dC8OPPP) is greater than monosubstituted (mC8OPPP) and the PPPs with longer side chains are much higher than a phenylene tetramer (P4) with two short methyl groups. Further, capping the dialkoxyl-susbstituents with a carbazole (Cz) moiety (CzPPP) provides enhanced extent of shielding. Excellent device efficiency of 30 cd/A (8.25%) for a green electrophosphorescent device can be achieved with CzPPP as a host, which is higher than that of dC8OPPP as host (15 cd/A). The efficiency is higher than those of high E(T) conjugated polymers, poly(3,6-carbazole) derivatives, as hosts (23 cd/A). This observation suggests a new route for molecular design of electroluminescent polymers as a host for a phosphorescent dopant.</abstracttext>]",['https://dx.doi.org/10.1021/ja076413i']

To break the limit, hUCB as a novel source of hUCB-derived stromal cells was incorporated in an attempt to expand CD34+ cells from hUCB in vitro. Cord blood CD34 cells were separated by MACS system. HUCB-derived stromal cells were cultured by the Dexter system and characterized by morphologic, immunophenotypical, and functional analysis. We studied the effects of hUCB-derived stromal cells, cytokines, and hUCB-derived stromal cells combined with cytokines on expansion of hUCB CD34 cells. The CD34+ cells were assessed for the degree of expansion and the number of colony-forming units in semisolid culture. Our research found that hUCB-derived stromal cells were mainly composed of three kinds of cell components, with CD106, CD29, CD44, CD45, CD50, CD68, CD31, Fn, Lm, and collagen IV positive, but CD34 negative immunophenotype. Functionally, it was discovered by cell cycle and growth curve analyses that the capability of colony and parietal layer formation of hUCB-derived stromal cells was poorer than that of BM stromal cells, and the doubling time of hUCB-derived stromal cells was longer than that of BM stromal cells. It was indicated by ELISA and RT-PCR that hUCB-derived stromal cells express higher level of TPO and less GM-CSF and SCF than BM stromal cell.

Discrete-event computer simulation over many years was used to represent surgical suites with an unchanging cancellation rate. Because the true cancellation rate was fixed, the accuracy of the statistical methods could be determined. Cancellations caused by medical events, rare events, cases lasting longer than scheduled, and full postanesthesia or intensive care unit beds were modeled. We found that applying Student's two-sample t-test to the transformation of the numbers of cases and canceled cases from each of six 4-wk periods was valid for most conditions. We recommend that clinicians and managers use this method in their quality monitoring reports. The other methods gave inaccurate results. For example, using chi(2) or Fisher's exact test, hospitals may erroneously determine that cancellation rates have increased when they really are unchanged.

This activity itself failed to stimulate in vitro granulocyte-macrophage colony (CFU-GM) formation but could increase the number of colonies induced by colony-stimulating factors (CSFs). CPA was produced by the adherent stromal cells but not by the nonadherent cells. No CPA could be detected in cultures of pure marrow fibroblasts, nor was it secreted by the stromal cells following macrophage depletion. In contrast, a large amount of CPA was found in cultures of isolated macrophages, suggesting that marrow macrophages may be the main cell source of CPA. Although colony formation was augmented by adding CPA in combination with various CSFs, the colony type induced by CPA plus CSF was no different from that of CSF alone. Preincubation of bone marrow (BM) cells with CPA at 37 degrees C for 24 hours before using in clonal culture assay resulted in a marked colony enhancement. Furthermore, colony formation by 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)-treated marrow cells could be induced by granulocyte-macrophage (GM)-CSF plus CPA but not by GM-CSF alone. These results suggest that CPA may act on early developing hematopoietic stem cells to induce them to differentiate into more mature myeloid progenitor cells capable of responding to CSF stimulation. CPA was nondialyzable and stable under heat (56 degrees C for 30 minutes) and freeze/thawing (3 times). Its activity was acid-labile (pH 2.0) but relatively alkaline-resistant (pH 11.0). When treated with enzymes, CPA was sensitive to trypsin and bacterial protease but not to neuraminidase. In addition, the activity of CPA could be abrogated by anti-CPA antiserum but remained unchanged after treatment with antibodies to other murine hematopoietic synergizing/stimulating factors, including interleukin-1 (IL-1), IL-3, IL-4, IL-6, and stem cell factor (SCF).</abstracttext>]",[]

Agents were administered i.p. on a daily x 9 schedule when mice developed tumors that were 50-100 mg in size. Drugs which are clinically effective against breast cancer were quite efficacious in the transgenic model at their maximum tolerated dose. Doxorubicin produced excellent responses in tumor-bearing transgenic mice, with several mammary carcinomas undergoing tumor shrinkage. Two anthrapyrazoles, DuP 937 and DuP 941, novel anticancer drugs with phase 2 activity against breast cancer, were as effective as doxorubicin in the oncomice. Mitoxantrone, a synthetic agent with some properties similar to the anthracyclines, also had antitumor activity, but not as pronounced as obtained with doxorubicin or the anthrapyrazoles. Cisplatin, a drug with limited use in human breast cancer, only caused modest antitumor responses. A computerized data analysis method based on the area under the tumor growth curve was developed to better quantitate the data and provide statistical information. This quantitative analysis confirmed the high statistical significance of the activity of doxorubicin or the anthrapyrazoles in the ras transgenic model, and defined an excellent dose response relationship for each drug tested.

"Elliott BE, Tam SP, <b>Dexter</b> D, <b>Chen</b> ZQ.",1992,1317363,Capacity of adipose tissue to promote growth and metastasis of a murine mammary carcinoma: effect of estrogen and progesterone.,International journal of cancer,"[<abstracttext>Previously we have shown that a murine mammary carcinoma cell line, designated SPI, grows and metastasizes more efficiently in the mammary gland than in the subcutis. In this report, we examine the tissue specificity of this phenomenon. Our results show that SPI cells grow best in the mesenteric and ovarian fat pads and well in the mammary gland, but very poorly in the subcutis or peritoneal cavity. Massive dissemination of tumors from the ovarian and mesenteric sites occurs to the liver, spleen and diaphragm. In contrast, metastases from the mammary site occur primarily in the lung. Co-transplantation of a threshold number of SPI cells with mammary or ovarian fat fragments into the subcutis results in increased tumor growth, whereas very few tumors form in sham controls receiving no fat fragments. Removal of the ovaries of donor and recipient mice abrogates tumor growth in adipose tissue transplants. Estrogen can stimulate growth of SPI in adipose tissue sites, whereas progesterone inhibits growth. In contrast, in vivo growth of a stable metastatic variant selected from SPI cells was not inhibited by progesterone. SPI cells growing in ovarian and mesenteric fat pads showed increased expression of estrogen receptors and progesterone receptors, as well as detectable levels of epidermal-growth-factor receptors, whereas receptor levels decreased to baseline on tumors in the subcutis. The levels of estrogen-receptor mRNA reflect the corresponding functional expression of receptors; this finding suggests that the regulation of estrogen-receptor expression in this system is, at least in part, at the mRNA level. Our results are consistent with the model that adipose tissue exerts an estrogen-dependent positive regulatory effect on primary SPI tumor growth, and promotes the formation of metastases.</abstracttext>]",['http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/openurl?genre=article&sid=nlm:pubmed&issn=0020-7136&date=1992&volume=51&issue=3&spage=416']

For induction of CSF release, various concentrations (0.5-40.0 microgram/ml) of bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) were added to nonrecharged 3-week-old LTBMCs consisting of an intact or macrophage-depleted adherent cell layer. The depletion of monocytes/macrophages from freshly prepared bone marrow cell suspension was performed by carbonyl-iron incorporation before establishment of LTBMC. The supernatants (Sup) of normal LTBMCs contained a low level of macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) that was produced by the adherent cells but not by the nonadherent cell elements. No colony inhibitor was found in the Sup of LTBMCs, whereas a colony-promoting activity (CPA) was detected in medium conditioned by the adherent marrow cells (AC-CM). CPA could enhance the colony formation of myeloid progenitor cells when used in combination with recombinant murine granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). The production of CSFs peaked at about 24 h after refeeding, but it then declined to only half the optimal activity at the end of the week. Addition of LPS to the intact LTBMC invariably increased the production of a GM-CSF-like cytokine. The release of this cytokine was dose dependent and peaked at a dosage of 20 micrograms/ml of LPS at 24 h after treatment. In contrast, macrophage-depleted marrow-adherent cells failed to respond to LPS for CSF secretion. These results suggest that LPS can stimulate marrow macrophages to directly release CSF or to potentiate the production of CSF by other stromal cells.</abstracttext>]",[]

Cells exposed to NSC 368390 became depleted in intracellular pools of uridine 5'-triphosphate and cytidine 5'-triphosphate. Both uridine 5'-triphosphate and cytidine 5'-triphosphate were decreased to 50% of levels in control cells at 3 h and were undetectable at 15 h after addition of 25 microM of NSC 368390 to the cultures. Similar effects were observed in L1210 leukemia cells.

Addition of uridine circumvented NSC 368390 cytotoxicity in L1210 cells, but addition of cytidine did not. This result is consistent with the fact that L1210 cells lack cytidine deaminase and thus cannot form uridine or its anabolites from cytidine.

Liver manganese is increased in patients lacking SLC30A10, but not SLC39A14. These organ-specific changes in manganese were recently recapitulated in knockout mice. Surprisingly, Slc30a10 knockouts also had elevated thyroid manganese and developed hypothyroidism. To determine the mechanisms of manganese-induced hypothyroidism and understand how SLC30A10 and SLC39A14 cooperatively mediate manganese detoxification, here we produced Slc39a14 single and Slc30a10/Slc39a14 double knockout mice and compared their phenotypes with those of Slc30a10 single knockouts. Compared with wildtype controls, Slc39a14 single and Slc30a10/Slc39a14 double knockouts had higher manganese levels in the blood and brain, but not the liver. In contrast, Slc30a10 single knockouts had elevated manganese in the liver as well as in the blood and brain. Furthermore, SLC30A10 and SLC39A14 localized to the canalicular and basolateral domains of polarized hepatic cells, respectively. Thus, transport activities of both SLC39A14 and SLC30A10 are required for hepatic manganese excretion. Compared with Slc30a10 single knockouts, Slc39a14 single and Slc30a10/Slc39a14 double knockouts had lower thyroid manganese levels and had normal thyroid function. Moreover, intra-thyroid thyroxine levels of Slc30a10 single knockouts were lower than those of controls. Thus, the hypothyroidism phenotype of Slc30a10 single knockouts is induced by elevated thyroid manganese, which blocks thyroxine production.

Hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection are well-known leading causes of HCC. However, the mechanism of the induction of HCC by these virus is still being debated. This review will focus on the current knowledge of the pathogenesis of HBV- and HCV-induced inflammation and the role of such immune activation in the tumorigenesis of HCC. It is well established that the recruitment of certain number and type of immune cells to liver is essential for the resolution of HBV and HCV infection and the prevention of subsequent chronic persistent infection. However, in case that the immune response do not completely clear virus, persistent chronic infection occurs, and the perpetual immune response may contribute to chronic damages of the liver. Such chronic inflammatory damages further harm hepatocytes, but not hepatic progenitor cells (HPCs). Thus, following chronic damages, HPCs are activated and their dysregulated proliferation ensures survival in the hostile environment, contributing to the tumorigenesis of HCC. Furthermore, accumulating evidence also provides a strong link between HPCs and human hepatocellular carcinoma.

Age-standardized incidence rates per 100,000 person-years were calculated by country and sex. Increases in new cases and rates of PLC are projected in both sexes. Among men, the largest increases in rates are in Norway (2.9% per annum), US whites (2.6%), and Canada (2.4%), and among women in the US (blacks 4.0%), Switzerland (3.4%), and Germany (3.0%). The projected declines are in China, Japan, Singapore, and parts of Europe (e.g. in Estonia, Czech Republic, Slovakia). A 35% increase in the number of new cases annually is expected compared to 2005.

One of the critical factors that impedes its successful outcome is the thermal heat sink effects from complex vascular systems that give rise to incomplete destruction of the target tumor tissue, resulting in therapy failure. To better understand the thermal influence of the complex vascular system during RFA, this work proposes the employment of two 3D fractal tree-like branched networks to investigate which key factors of the tree-like vascular system impact heating process. A three-dimensional finite difference analysis is employed to simulate the RFA treatment. Based on the data acquired from the measured experiments, the simulated results derived from combining the Pennes bioheat model and the boundary condition-enforced immersed boundary method (IBM) have demonstrated close agreement with experimental data with a maximum discrepancy of ±8.3%. We employed the orthogonal design approach to analyze 3 factors, namely, the blood vessel's volume, the average distance between probe center and the blood vessel system and the number of the selected part's branches at three different levels. Results have revealed that the distance between RFA probe and blood vessel plays a major role during the heating process compared with the other two factors.

Glial cell-derived tumors and the cells derived from them are highly heterogeneous and variable in their mechanical properties, their response to treatments, and their properties in vitro. Some glioma samples are stiffer than normal brain when measured ex vivo, but even those that are soft in vitro stiffen after deformation by pressure gradients that arise in the tumor environment in vivo. Such mechanical differences can strongly alter the phenotype of cultured glioma cells. Alternatively, chemical signaling might elicit the same phenotype as increased stiffness by activating intracellular messengers common to both initial stimuli. In this study the responses of three different human glioma cell lines to changes in substrate stiffness are compared to their responses on very soft substrates composed of a combination of hyaluronic acid and a specific integrin ligand, either laminin or collagen I. By quantifying cell morphology, stiffness, motility, proliferation, and secretion of the cytokine IL-8, glioma cell responses to increased stiffness are shown to be nearly identically elicited by substrates containing hyaluronic acid, even in the absence of increased stiffness. PI3-kinase activity was required for the response to hyaluronan but not to stiffness. This outcome suggests that hyaluronic acid can trigger the same cellular response as can be obtained by mechanical force transduced from a stiff environment and demonstrates that chemical and mechanical features of the tumor microenvironment can achieve equivalent reactions in cancer cells.</abstracttext>]",[],[],['https://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.biomac.7b00324']

Targeted delivery of therapeutic drugs to the tumor-promoting M2-like TAMs is challenging. Here, we developed excellent M2-like TAM dual-targeting nanoparticles (M2NPs), whose structure and function were controlled by α-peptide (a scavenger receptor B type 1 (SR-B1) targeting peptide) linked with M2pep (an M2 macrophage binding peptide). By loading anti-colony stimulating factor-1 receptor (anti-CSF-1R) small interfering RNA (siRNA) on the M2NPs, we developed a molecular-targeted immunotherapeutic approach to specifically block the survival signal of M2-like TAMs and deplete them from melanoma tumors. We confirmed the validity of SR-B1 for M2-like TAM targeting and demonstrated the synergistic effect of the two targeting units (α-peptide and M2pep) in the fusion peptide (α-M2pep). After being administered to tumor-bearing mice, M2NPs had higher affinity to M2-like TAMs than to tissue-resident macrophages in liver, spleen and lung. Compared with control treatment groups, M2NP-based siRNA delivery resulted in a dramatic elimination of M2-like TAMs (52%), decreased tumor size (87%) and prolonged survival. Additionally, this molecular-targeted strategy inhibited immunosuppressive IL-10 and TGF-β production, increased immuno-stimulatory cytokines (IL-12 and IFN-γ) expression and CD8+ T cell infiltration (2.9-fold) in tumor microenvironment. Moreover, the siRNA-carrying M2NPs down-regulated expression of the exhaustion markers (PD-1 and Tim-3) on the infiltrating CD8+ T cells and stimulated their IFN-γ secretion (6.2-fold), indicating the restoration of T cell immune function. Thus, the dual-targeting property of M2NPs combined with RNA interference provide a potential strategy of molecular-targeted cancer immunotherapy for clinical application.</abstracttext>]",[],[],['https://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsnano.7b05465']

Several factors contribute to variations in busulfan drug disposition including bioavailability, age, liver function, genetic polymorphisms, and concurrent administration of other drugs. Busulfan is metabolized by hepatic oxidation via the cytochrome P450 3A4 system as well as through conjugation with glutathione. Interactions with drugs such as phenytoin, itraconazole, and metronidazole have been reported to alter busulfan clearance and result in sub- or supra-therapeutic concentrations. We report a case of a clinically significant drug interaction between intravenous busulfan and the bifunctional T-cell engager, blinatumomab, observed through busulfan therapeutic drug monitoring. We found that busulfan clearance was reduced resulting in a higher area under the concentration-time curve when it was administered 48 h after blinatumomab. Repeat busulfan pharmacokinetic testing two weeks later demonstrated increased clearance of the drug and a 31% higher dose recommendation. Similar to other protein therapeutics, cytokine elevations during blinatumomab treatment can lead to cytochrome 3A4 suppression. We hypothesize that the increased busulfan levels observed could be related to a cytokine-mediated CYP3A4 suppression. This represents a unique pharmacologic consideration in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation which would impact several drugs that undergo CYP3A4 metabolism, including calcineurin inhibitors, cyclophosphamide, sirolimus, and triazole antifungals. Additionally, this mechanism of CYP3A4 suppression may be relevant in treatments and disease states where cytokine levels are elevated such as haploidentical stem cell transplantation, graft-versus-host disease, and use of chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy.</abstracttext>]","[<div class=""keywords""><h4>KEYWORDS: </h4><p>Busulfan; blinatumomab; cytokines; therapeutic drug monitoring</p></div>]",[],['http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1078155217729745?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&rfr_dat=cr_pub%3dpubmed']

In this study, we performed a genome-wide comprehensive analysis of lncRNAs profiling and clinical relevance to identify novel lncRNAs for the further study in CRC. RNA sequencing and microarray data obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) were annotated and analyzed to find differentially expressed lncRNAs in CRC. Analysis of these datasets revealed that hundreds of lncRNAs expression are dysregulated in CRC tissues when compared with normal tissues. By genomic variation analyses, we identified that some of these lncRNAs dysregulation is associated with the copy number amplification or deletion. Moreover, many lncRNAs expression levels are significantly associated with CRC patients overall and recurrence-free survivals, such as H19, LEF1-AS1, and RP11-296E3.2. Furthermore, we identified one liver metastasis-associated lncRNA termed LUCAT1 in CRC by analyzing lncRNAs expression profiles in the CRC tissues from patients with liver metastasis compared with the CRC tissues without metastasis. Finally, loss-of-function assays determined that knockdown of LUCAT1 could impair CRC cells invasion.

Timely detection of this pathology is necessary to delay or interrupt lung cancer progression, ultimately resulting in a possible better prognosis for the patient. In this context, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is especially promising. Ultra-short echo time (UTE) MRI sequences, in combination with gadolinium-based contrast agents, have indeed shown to be especially adapted to the detection of lung neoplastic lesions at submillimeter precision. Manganese-enhanced MRI (MEMRI) increasingly appears to be a possible effective alternative to gadolinium-enhanced MRI. In this work, we investigated whether low-dose MEMRI can effectively target non-small-cell lung cancer in rodents, whilst minimizing the potential toxic effect of manganese. Both systemic and orotracheal administration modalities allowed the identification of tumors of submillimeter size, as confirmed by bioluminescence imaging and histology. Equivalent tumor signal enhancements and contrast-to-noise ratios were observed with orotracheal administration using 20 times lower doses compared with the more conventional systemic route. This finding is of crucial importance as it supports the observation that higher performances of contrast agents can be obtained using an orotracheal administration route when targeting lung diseases. As a consequence, lower concentrations of contrast media can be employed, reducing the dose and potential safety issues. The non-detectable accumulation of ionic manganese in the brain and liver following orotracheal administration observed in vivo is extremely encouraging with regard to the safety of the orotracheal protocol with low-dose Mn<sup>2+</sup> administration. To our knowledge, this is the first time that a study has clearly allowed the high-precision detection of lung tumor and its contours via the synergic employment of a strongly T<sub>1</sub> -weighted MRI UTE sequence and ionic manganese, an inexpensive contrast agent.

Given the relevant pathogenic role of mitochondrial and fatty acid metabolism in hepatocarcinoma (HCC), here we pointed to PGC-1β as a putative novel transcriptional player in the development and progression of HCC. For this purpose, we generated both hepatic-specific PGC-1β overexpressing (LivPGC-1β) and PGC-1β knockout (LivPGC-1βKO) mice, and we challenged them with both chemical and genetic models of hepatic carcinogenesis. Our results demonstrate a pivotal role of PGC-1β in driving liver tumor development. Indeed, whereas mice overexpressing PGC-1β show greater tumor susceptibility, PGC-1β knockout mice are protected from carcinogenesis. High levels of PGC-1β are able to boost ROS scavenger expression, therefore limiting the detrimental ROS accumulation and, consequently, apoptosis. Moreover, it supports tumor anabolism, enhancing the expression of genes involved in fatty acid and triglyceride synthesis. Accordingly, the specific hepatic ablation of PGC-1β promotes the accumulation of ROS-driven macromolecule damage, finally limiting tumor growth .

As the liver deforms during the operation, deviation between the target area determined during pre-operative planning and the resultant ablation area is inevitable. Therefore, an accurate assessment of tumor coverage is crucial for treatment. Through registration between the pre- and post-operative livers, the ablation area is warped on the pre-operative liver for the computation of tumor coverage. However, large deformations between the pre- and post-operative livers are caused by multiple factors, and these diverse deformations make registration a challenging task. The purpose of this paper is to develop an automatic method that can accurately register post- to pre-operative livers.</abstracttext>, <abstracttext label=""METHODS"" nlmcategory=""METHODS"">In the proposed method, non-rigid deformations caused by respiratory movement and edema are separately considered and estimated by the local incompressible model in the registration of livers. The pre- and post-operative livers are first aligned by a rigid registration based on a convex hull. In the non-rigid registrations, local incompressible constraints are then set on the liver and the ablation area to estimate the deformations caused by respiratory movement and edema, respectively. The concatenation of the rigid and non-rigid deformations is used to warp the ablation area on the pre-operative liver.</abstracttext>, <abstracttext label=""RESULTS"" nlmcategory=""RESULTS"">The proposed method was evaluated using clinical CT datasets from 20 patients. The Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) between the pre-operative and warped post-operative livers is 94.35%, the mean surface distance (MSD) between the livers is 1.65 mm, the mean hausdorff distance (HDD) between the livers is 3.36 mm, and the mean corresponding distance (MCD) between the corresponding landmarks is 1.70 mm. Compared with five other state-of-the-art methods, the proposed method achieves automatic ablation assessment with highly accurate registration.</abstracttext>, <abstracttext label=""CONCLUSIONS"" nlmcategory=""CONCLUSIONS"">The proposed method achieves a high accuracy for registering the livers.

Recently we have shown that BCD has an anti-inflammatory effect on CC via suppression of the inflammasome and liver X receptor activation. The putative effects of BCD on CC-induced complement activation remain unknown. In this study, we found that BCD bound to CC and reduced deposition of Igs, pattern recognition molecules, and complement factors on CC in human plasma. Furthermore, BCD decreased complement activation as measured by terminal complement complex and lowered the expression of complement receptors on monocytes in whole blood in response to CC exposure. In line with this, BCD also reduced reactive oxygen species formation caused by CC in whole blood. Furthermore, BCD attenuated the CC-induced proinflammatory cytokine responses (e.g., IL-1α, MIP-1α, TNF, IL-6, and IL-8) as well as regulated a range of CC-induced genes in human PBMC. BCD also regulated complement-related genes in human carotid plaques treated ex vivo. Formation of terminal complement complex on other complement-activating structures such as monosodium urate crystals and zymosan was not affected by BCD. These data demonstrate that BCD inhibits CC-induced inflammatory responses, which may be explained by BCD-mediated attenuation of complement activation.

Given the activating role that some PTKs play in initiating growth factor-mediated cellular processes, PTPs are usually perceived as the negative regulators of these events and therefore tumor suppressive in nature. However, mounting evidence indicate that PTPs do not always antagonize the activity of PTKs in regulating tyrosine phosphorylation, but can also play dominant roles in the initiation and progression of signaling cascades that regulate cell functions. It follows therefore that PTP malfunction can actively contribute to a host of human disorders in particular: cancer, metabolic syndromes and autoimmune diseases. The Src homology domain containing phosphatase 2 (SHP2) and the three-membered family of phosphatases of regenerating liver (PRLs) are infamously oncogenic members of the PTP superfamily.

It is highly refractory to most systemic therapies. Recently, significant progress has been made in uncovering genomic alterations in HCC, including potentially targetable aberrations. The most common molecular anomalies in this malignancy are mutations in the TERT promoter, TP53, CTNNB1, AXIN1, ARID1A, CDKN2A and CCND1 genes. PTEN loss at the protein level is also frequent. Genomic portfolios stratify by risk factors as follows: (i) CTNNB1 with alcoholic cirrhosis; and (ii) TP53 with hepatitis B virus-induced cirrhosis. Activating mutations in CTNNB1 and inactivating mutations in AXIN1 both activate WNT signaling. Alterations in this pathway, as well as in TP53 and the cell cycle machinery, and in the PI3K/Akt/mTor axis (the latter activated in the presence of PTEN loss), as well as aberrant angiogenesis and epigenetic anomalies, appear to be major events in HCC. Many of these abnormalities may be pharmacologically tractable. Immunotherapy with checkpoint inhibitors is also emerging as an important treatment option. Indeed, 82% of patients express PD-L1 (immunohistochemistry) and response rates to anti-PD-1 treatment are about 19%, and include about 5% complete remissions as well as durable benefit in some patients. Biomarker-matched trials are still limited in this disease, and many of the genomic alterations in HCC remain challenging to target. Future studies may require combination regimens that include both immunotherapies and molecularly matched targeted treatments.</abstracttext>]","[<div class=""keywords""><h4>KEYWORDS: </h4><p>Hepatocellular carcinoma; Molecular targeted therapyg; Next-generation sequencing</p></div>]",[],['https://molecular-cancer.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12943-017-0712-x']

Abiraterone acetate (AA) therapy is associated with toxicities, including hypokalemia, hypertension, liver function test abnormalities and cardiac events. These adverse events are traditionally managed with a standard dose of corticosteroids. However, preliminary data are available on the use of a lower dose of corticosteroids. The aim of this report is to perform a pooled analysis evaluating the risk ratio (RR) of AA-related adverse events of special interest associated with low or standard dose of corticosteroids. A total of 5374 cases from 4 randomized clinical trials were included. Subgroup analysis according to corticosteroids dosage revealed a higher RR of adverse events associated with a dose of 5 mg, compared to 10 mg. In particular, there was a statistically significant higher RR of hypokalemia and ALT/AST increase, and only a modest risk increase for cardiac disorders and hypertension. In conclusion, given the limitations of a literature-based study, in comparison with a meta-analysis based on individual patients' data, our study identified a relatively small increase in RR for hypertension and cardiac disorders and a bigger increase of RR for hypokalemia and ALT/AST toxicity when 5 mg, rather than 10 mg of corticosteroids were administered to manage adverse events of special interest from AA.

An aptamer is a short single-stranded DNA selected from a synthetic DNA library that is capable of binding to its target with high affinity and specificity based on its unique DNA sequence and 3D structure after folding. Similar to the BBC assay, Cyto-c is captured by a micro-magnetic particle (MMP) coated with capturing antibodies (Ab) and an aptamer specifically against Cyto-c to form sandwich structures ([MMP-Ab]-[Cyto-c]-[Aptamer]). After washing and melting, our aptamers, acting as a DNA bio-barcode, are released from the sandwiches and hybridized with the probes specially designed for RNase H for surface plasmon resonance (SPR) sensing. In an aptamer-probe duplex, RNase H digests the RNA in the probe and releases the intact aptamer for another round of hybridization and digestion. With signal enhancement effects from gold-nanorods (Au-NRs) on probes for SPR sensing, the detection limit was found to be 1 nM for the aptamer and 80 pM for Cyto-c. Without the time-consuming DNA amplification steps by PCR, the detection process of this new ABC assay can be completed within three hours. As a proof-of-concept, phenylarsine oxide was found to be a potent agent to kill liver cancer cells with multi-drug resistance at the nano-molar level.

Work done prior to the discovery of amebic trogocytosis showed that acid vesicles are required for amebic cytotoxicity. In the present study, we show that acidified lysosomes are required for amebic trogocytosis and cell killing. Interference with lysosome acidification using ammonium chloride, a weak base, or concanamycin A, a vacuolar H<sup>+</sup> ATPase inhibitor, decreased amebic trogocytosis and amebic cytotoxicity. Our data suggest that the inhibitors do not impair the ingestion of an initial fragment but rather block continued trogocytosis and the ingestion of multiple fragments. The acidification inhibitors also decreased phagocytosis, but not fluid-phase endocytosis. These data suggest that amebic lysosomes play a crucial role in amebic trogocytosis, phagocytosis, and cell killing.<b>IMPORTANCE</b><i>E. histolytica</i> is a protozoan parasite that is prevalent in low-income countries, where it causes potentially fatal diarrhea, dysentery, and liver abscesses. Tissue destruction is a hallmark of invasive <i>E. histolytica</i> infection. The parasite is highly cytotoxic to a wide range of human cells, and parasite cytotoxic activity is likely to drive tissue destruction. <i>E. histolytica</i> is able to kill human cells through amebic trogocytosis. This process also contributes to tissue invasion. Trogocytosis has been observed in other organisms; however, little is known about the mechanism in any system. We show that interference with lysosomal acidification impairs amebic trogocytosis, phagocytosis, and cell killing, indicating that amebic lysosomes are critically important for these processes.</abstracttext>]","[<div class=""keywords""><h4>KEYWORDS: </h4><p>Entamoeba histolytica; enteric pathogens; host-pathogen interactions; trogocytosis</p></div>]",[],"['http://mbio.asm.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=28851845', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmid/28851845/']"

We present results from an unbiased in vivo chemical screen in zebrafish that identifies GCs as activators of hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) in the liver. GCs activated consensus hypoxia response element (HRE) reporters in a glucocorticoid receptor (GR)-dependent manner. Importantly, GCs activated HIF transcriptional responses in a zebrafish mutant line harboring a point mutation in the GR DNA-binding domain, suggesting a nontranscriptional route for GR to activate HIF signaling. We noted that GCs increase the transcription of several key regulators of glucose metabolism that contain HREs, suggesting a role for GC/HIF cross-talk in regulating glucose homeostasis. Importantly, we show that GCs stabilize HIF protein in intact human liver tissue and isolated hepatocytes. We find that GCs limit the expression of Von Hippel Lindau protein (pVHL), a negative regulator of HIF, and that treatment with the c-src inhibitor PP2 rescued this effect, suggesting a role for GCs in promoting c-src-mediated proteosomal degradation of pVHL.

Here, we report that c‑Myc plays an important role in abrogating contact inhibition in human cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) cells. Our data show that the protein level of c‑Myc obviously decreased in contact-inhibited normal biliary epithelial cells. However, CCA cells sustain high protein levels of c‑Myc and keep strong proliferation ability in confluent conditions. Importantly, the suppression of c‑Myc by inhibitor or siRNA induced G0/G1 phase cell cycle arrest in confluent CCA cells. We demonstrate that the inhibition of c‑Myc suppressed the activity of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) in confluent CCA cells, and mTOR inhibition induced G0/G1 phase cell cycle arrest in confluent CCA cells. In confluent CCA cells, the activity of Merlin is downregulated, and Yes-associated protein (YAP) sustains high levels of activity. Furthermore, YAP inhibition not only induced G0/G1 phase cell cycle arrest, but also decreased c‑Myc expression in confluent CCA cells. These results indicate that Merlin/YAP/c‑Myc/mTOR signaling axis promotes human CCA cell proliferation by overriding contact inhibition.

Epithelial‑mesenchymal transition (EMT) of cancer cells has been associated cancer metastasis; however, the implication of FoxM1 in EMT and its putative roles in the regulation of cancer metastasis remain to be elucidated. In the present study, the expression of FoxM1, Snai1 and E‑cadherin in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell lines with various metastatic potentials, and in normal liver cells, was investigated using western blot analysis and reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The effects of FoxM1 on the invasive and migratory capabilities of HCC cells were evaluated using wound healing and Transwell migration assays. The present results demonstrated that FoxM1 expression was significantly upregulated in HCC cells compared with in normal hepatocytes (P&lt;0.05). In addition, FoxM1 expression was significantly increased in MHCC‑LM3 cells, characterized by higher metastatic potential, compared with in SMMC‑7721 cells, which have a lower metastatic potential. Furthermore, overexpression of FoxM1 was demonstrated to be negatively correlated with E‑cadherin (P&lt;0.05) and positively associated with Snai1 (P&lt;0.05) expression. These observations suggested that FoxM1 may enhance the invasion and migration of cancer cells, and thus promotes their EMT, in a mechanism that may involve the regulation of Snai1. Therefore, it may be hypothesized that FoxM1 has potential as a novel diagnostic marker and therapeutic target for the treatment of patients with HCC.</abstracttext>]",[],[],['http://www.spandidos-publications.com/10.3892/mmr.2017.7223']

Nevertheless, minimally invasive liver surgery is gaining ground and conventional laparoscopy has proven to be beneficial in different fields of liver surgery compared to open resections. Still, conventional laparoscopy has a few downsides, from which straight instruments, 2-dimensional view and awkward ergonomics are the most obvious. The robotic surgical system is developed to overcome these limitations. It offers several advantages over conventional laparoscopy to optimize conditions in minimally invasive surgery: instruments are wristed with a wide range of motion and the view is 3-dimensional and magnified. With instruments with a greater range of motion than in laparoscopic surgery, the use of a robotic system potentially broadens indications for minimally invasive liver resection.

There may be associated glomerulonephritis. The process of infection is difficult to disrupt because eating practices have proven extremely difficult to change, and the life cycle of the fluke cannot be broken due to high prevalence in canine and feline reservoir hosts. Fecal analysis and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay tests can be used to diagnose opisthorchiasis. Diagnosis of CCA is complex, partly due to the lack of definitive imaging characteristics but also due to the difficulty of obtaining samples for cytology or histology. This cancer has proven to be resistant to common chemotherapy treatments and so the two avenues of treatment available are surgical resection and liver transplantation, both requiring early detection of the tumor for the best chances of success. Late presentation of symptoms reduces the chances of successful surgical intervention.

The synthesized AgNps were characterized by FTIR, TEM, FESEM, XRD and EDX analysis. The EDS spectrum revealed that the synthesized nanoparticles (Nps) were composed of 55.45% Ag atoms of spherical shape with approximately 50nm size, identified from TEM and FESEM data. The antiproliferation effect of the AgNps varies with cell lines in a concentration dependent manner. The result showed that the AgNps were more effective on PC3 (IC<sub>50</sub> 23.48μg/mL) than MCF7 (29.25μg/mL) and HepG2 (33.25μg/mL) by the virtue of their IC<sub>50</sub> values.

Here the protein is enriched at actin filament bundles associated with junctional plaques. Polarized epithelial cells contain two types of actin-associated complexes, one comprising drebrin but not vinculin and the other involving vinculin, but not drebrin. At gap junctions drebrin interacts with connexin 43, stabilizes this protein at membranes, and links it to the actin cytoskeleton. In vivo drebrin is widespread in diverse non-neuronal tissues of epithelial, endothelial, and smooth muscle origin, but not ubiquitous. In intestinal cells it is involved in cell compaction, linking of actin filaments to microtubules and formation and stabilization of the terminal web.

Among several candidates, the natural compound 20(S)-25-methoxyl-dammarane-3β, 12β, 20-triol (25-OCH<sub>3</sub>-PPD, GS25) was identified to clearly inhibit the luciferase activity of Co.RE.

Interestingly, GS25 showed preferential inhibition of HepG2 cell viability relative to normal liver L02 cells. Further investigation showed that GS25 could not induce apoptosis and block activation of STAT3 and ERK pathways in L02 cells as efficiently as in HepG2 cells, which may result in differential effects of GS25 on malignant and normal liver cells. In addition, GS25 was found to potently suppress the expression of endogenous STAT3 at a higher concentration and dramatically induce p38 phosphorylation in HepG2 cells, which could mediate its anti-cancer effects. Finally, we demonstrated that GS25 also inhibited tumor growth in HepG2 xenograft mice. Taken together, these findings indicate that GS25 elicits its anti-cancer effects on HepG2 cells through multiple mechanisms and has the potential to be used as an inhibitor of IL-6 signaling.

The engineered scaffold protein ABD-.derived affinity protein (ADAPT) is a promising tracer for radionuclide molecular imaging due to its small size (6.5 kDa), that provides precondition for efficient tumor penetration and rapid clearance. Previous studies demonstrated that the human epidermal growth factor receptor type 2 (HER2)-targeting ADAPT6 labeled with radiometals at the N-terminus provides imaging of HER2 expression in xenografts a few hours after injection. The aim of this study was to evaluate if the use of a non-residualizing label or placement of the labels at the C-terminus would further improve targeting properties of ADAPT6. <b>Methods:</b> Two constructs, Cys2-ADAPT6 and Cys59-ADAPT6, having the (HE)3DANS-sequence at the N-terminus were produced and site-specifically labeled using <sup>111</sup>In-DOTA or <sup>125</sup>I-iodo-((4-hydroxyphenyl)ethyl) maleimide (HPEM).

Intraarterial therapy options for colorectal liver metastases include chemoinfusion via a hepatic arterial pump or port, irinotecan-loaded drug-eluting beads, and radioembolization using <sup>90</sup>Y microspheres. Intraarterial therapy allows the delivery of a high dose of chemotherapy or radiation into liver tumors while minimizing the impact on liver parenchyma and avoiding systemic effects. Specificity in intraarterial therapy can be achieved both through preferential arterial flow to the tumor and through selective catheter positioning. In this review, we discuss indications, contraindications, preprocedure evaluation, activity prescription, follow-up, outcomes, and complications of radioembolization of colorectal liver metastases. Methods for preventing off-target embolization, increasing the specificity of microsphere delivery, and reducing the lung-shunt fraction are discussed. There are 2 types of <sup>90</sup>Y microspheres: resin and glass. Because glass microspheres have a higher activity per particle, they can deliver a particular radiation dose with fewer particles, likely reducing embolic effects. Glass microspheres thus may be more suitable when early stasis or reflux is a concern, in the setting of hepatocellular carcinoma with portal vein invasion, and for radiation segmentectomy. Because resin microspheres have a lower activity per particle, more particles are needed to deliver a particular radiation dose. Resin microspheres thus may be preferable for larger tumors and those with high arterial flow. In addition, resin microspheres have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for colorectal liver metastases, whereas institutional review board approval is required before glass microspheres can be used under a compassionate-use or research protocol. Finally, radiation segmentectomy involves delivering a calculated lobar activity of <sup>90</sup>Y microspheres selectively to treat a tumor involving 1 or 2 liver segments. This technique administers a very high radiation dose and effectively causes the ablation of tumors that are too large or are in a location considered unsafe for thermal ablation.

In the past two decades, many drebrin-binding proteins in addition to F-actin have been identified in several research fields including neuroscience, oncology, and immunology. Among the drebrin-binding proteins, there are various kinds of proteins including scaffold proteins, nuclear proteins, phosphatases, microtubule-binding proteins, G-actin-binding proteins, gap junction proteins, chemokine receptors, and cell-adhesion-related proteins. The interaction between drebrin and its binding partners seems to play important roles in higher brain functions, because drebrin is involved in the pathogenesis of some neurological diseases with cognitive defects. In this chapter, we will first review the interaction of Homer and spikar with drebrin, particularly focusing on spine morphogenesis and synaptic function. Homer contributes to spine morphogenesis by cooperating with shank and activated Cdc42 small GTPase, suggesting a novel signaling pathway comprising Homer, drebrin, shank, and Cdc42 for spine morphogenesis. Drebrin sequesters spikar in the cytoplasm and stabilizes it in dendritic spines, leading to spine formation.

Drebrin is an actin-binding protein, which is classified into two major isoforms produced by alternative splicing from a single DBN1 gene. The isoform predominantly expressed in the adult brain (drebrin A) is neuron specific, containing a neuron-specific sequence (Ins2) in the middle of the molecule. Drebrin A is highly concentrated in dendritic spines, and its accumulation level is regulated by synaptic activity. In contrast, drebrin E, which lacks Ins2, is found in widespread but not ubiquitous cell types in various tissues. The isoform conversion from drebrin E to drebrin A occurs in parallel with synaptogenesis. Drebrin decorating F-actin is found at the recipient side of cell-cell communication systems, such as gap junctions, adherens junctions, immunological synapses, and neuronal synapses. In addition, it is involved in the cellular mechanisms of cell migration, cell process formation, cancer metastasis, and spermatogenesis. Lack of drebrin leads to the dysfunction of cell-cell communication, resulting in aberrant migration of metastatic cancer cells, aberrant synaptic function in dementia, and rupture of endothelial integrity. Because drebrin forms a unique F-actin with a longer helical crossover, drebrin may create an F-actin platform for molecular assembly and play a pivotal role in intercellular communication.</abstracttext>]","[<div class=""keywords""><h4>KEYWORDS: </h4><p>Alternative splicing; Cancer; Cell migration; Intercellular communication; Physical property of actin filament; Synaptic plasticity; Synaptogenesis</p></div>]",[],['https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-4-431-56550-5_1']

Despite immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy becoming the standard of care across multiple tumor types, there are many unanswered questions that need to be addressed before this therapeutic modality can be fully harnessed. Areas of limitations include treatment of patients not sufficiently represented in clinical trials, uncertainty of the optimal treatment dosing and duration, and lack of understanding regarding long-term immune related toxicities and atypical tumor responses. Patients such as those with autoimmune disease, chronic viral infections, limited performance status, and brain metastases were often excluded from initial trials due to concerns of safety. However, limited data suggest that some of these patients can benefit from therapy with manageable toxicities; thus, future studies should incorporate these patients to clearly define safety and efficacy. There are still controversies regarding the optimal dosing strategy that can vary from weight-based to flat dosing, with undefined treatment duration. Further elucidation of the optimal dosing approach and evaluation of predictive biomarkers should be incorporated in the design of future trials. Finally, there are long-term immune-mediated toxicities, atypical tumor responses such as pseudoprogression and endpoints unique to immuno-oncology that are not adequately captured by traditional trial designs; thus, novel study designs are needed.

Mitochondria were isolated from 4-month-old wild-type mice, transgenic mice carrying the APP<sub>SWE</sub> and PSEN1<sub>dE9</sub> mutations, mice with decreased brain and mitochondrial ascorbate (vitamin C) via heterozygous knockout of the sodium dependent vitamin C transporter (SVCT2+/-) and transgenic APP/PSEN1 mice with heterozygous SVCT2 expression. Mitochondrial isolates from SVCT2+/- mice were observed to consume less oxygen using high-resolution respirometry, and also exhibited decreased mitochondrial membrane potential compared to wild type isolates. Conversely, isolates from young (4 months) APP/PSEN1 mice consumed more oxygen, and exhibited an increase in mitochondrial membrane potential, but had a significantly lower ATP/ADP ratio compared to wild type isolates. Greater levels of reactive oxygen species were also produced in mitochondria isolated from both APP/PSEN1 and SVCT2+/- mice compared to wild type isolates. Acute administration of ascorbate to mitochondria isolated from wild-type mice increased oxygen consumption compared with untreated mitochondria suggesting ascorbate may support energy production. This study suggests that both presence of amyloid and ascorbate deficiency can contribute to mitochondrial dysfunction, even at an early, prodromal stage of Alzheimer's disease, although occurring via different pathways.

One strategy to mitigate this neurotoxicity is hippocampus-avoiding (HA) whole-brain radiation therapy, as the hippocampus is mainly responsible for radiation-related NCD and hippocampal or perihippocampal metastases are rare. A few prospective clinical trials have demonstrated a reduction in NCD following HA whole-brain radiation therapy. The 59-year-old male patient described in this report had limited-stage SCLC and a complete response to thoracic chemoradiotherapy. Seven months after receiving HA-PCI of 25 Gy in 10 fractions using intensity-modulated radiation therapy, a 36 mm solitary metastasis was detected in the right perihippocampal region. The mass was surgically removed but the patient died 2 months later. The development of a solitary HA region metastasis is uncommon, considering that metastasis in this area usually occurs in patients with high numbers of BMs. Our case demonstrates the need for further validation of HA-PCI for SCLC patients in terms of both neurocognitive protection and the absence of compromise in terms of BM prevention.</abstracttext>]","[<div class=""keywords""><h4>KEYWORDS: </h4><p>brain metastasis; cognition; hippocampus-sparing; lung cancer; neurotoxicity; whole brain radiation therapy</p></div>]",[],['https://dx.doi.org/10.2147/OTT.S143719']

The inherent complexity of fMRI, which includes numerous processing steps and selective analyses, is compounded by institution-unique approaches to patient training, paradigm choice, and an eclectic array of postprocessing options from various vendors. Consequently, institutions perform fMRI in such markedly different manners that data sharing, comparison, and generalization of results are difficult. The American Society of Functional Neuroradiology proposes widespread adoption of common fMRI language paradigms as the first step in countering this lost opportunity to advance our knowledge and improve patient care.</abstracttext>, <abstracttext label=""LANGUAGE PARADIGM REVIEW PROCESS"" nlmcategory=""UNASSIGNED"">A taskforce of American Society of Functional Neuroradiology members from multiple institutions used a broad literature review, member polls, and expert opinion to converge on 2 sets of standard language paradigms that strike a balance between ease of application and clinical usefulness.</abstracttext>, <abstracttext label=""ASFNR RECOMMENDATIONS"" nlmcategory=""UNASSIGNED"">The taskforce generated an adult language paradigm algorithm for presurgical language assessment including the following tasks: Sentence Completion, Silent Word Generation, Rhyming, Object Naming, and/or Passive Story Listening.

To identify potential novel therapies, we characterized inflammatory and immunomodulatory factors in ACP cyst fluid and solid tumor components. Cytometric bead analysis revealed a highly pro-inflammatory cytokine pattern in fluid from ACP compared to fluids from another cystic pediatric brain tumor, pilocytic astrocytoma.

Early studies have shown that immunoglobulin free light chains (FLC) can trigger mast cell activation in an antigen-specific manner. Increased expression of FLC is observed within the stroma of many human cancers including those of breast, colon, lung, pancreas, kidney, and skin. These overexpressed FLCs are co-localized to areas of mast cell infiltration. Importantly, FLC expression is associated with basal-like cancers with an aggressive phenotype. Moreover, FLC is expressed in areas of inflammatory cell infiltration and its expression is significantly associated with poor clinical outcome.

Here we evaluated the contribution of endogenous FGFBP1 to development and homeostasis as well as to skin pathologies utilizing Fgfbp1-knockout (KO) mice. Relative to wild-type (WT) littermates KO mice showed no gross pathologies. Still, in KO mice a significant thickening of the epidermis associated with a decreased transepidermal water loss and increased pro-inflammatory gene expression in the skin was detected. Also, skin carcinogen challenge by DMBA/TPA resulted in delayed and reduced papillomatosis in KO mice. This was paralleled by delayed healing of skin wounds and reduced angiogenic sprouting in subcutaneous matrigel plugs. Heterozygous GFP-knock-in mice revealed rapid induction of gene expression during papilloma induction and during wound healing. Examination of WT skin grafted onto Fgfbp1 GFP knockin reporter hosts and bone marrow transplants from the GFP reporter model into WT hosts revealed that circulating Fgfbp1-expressing cells migrate into healing wounds.

Despite various available treatment methods and advances in noninvasive diagnostic techniques, the incidence of metastatic cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma is rising. Deficiency in effective preventive or treatment methods of transformed keratinocytes leads to necessity of searching for new anticancer agents. The present study aims to evaluate the possibility of using wool hydrolysates as such agents. Commercially available compounds such as 5-fluorouracil, ingenol mebutate, diclofenac sodium salt were also used in this study. The process of wool degradation was based on chemical pre-activation and enzymatic digestion of wool. The effect of mentioned compounds on cell viability of squamous carcinoma cell line and healthy keratinocytes was evaluated. The obtained data show a significantly stronger effect of selected wool hydrolysates compared to commercial compounds (p&lt;0.05) on viability of cells. The wool hydrolysates decreased squamous cell carcinoma cells viability by up to 67% comparing to untreated cells.

Clinically, patients with V600K tumors experience distant metastases sooner and have an increased risk of relapse and shorter survival than patients with V600E tumors. Despite the clinical and other histopathological differences between these BRAF tumor subtypes, little is known about them at the genomic level. Herein, we systematically compared BRAF V600E and V600K skin cutaneous melanoma (SKCM) samples from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) for differential protein, gene, and microRNA expression genome-wide using the Mann-Whitney U-test. Our analyses showed that elements of energy-metabolism and protein-translation pathways were upregulated and that proapoptotic pathways were downregulated in V600K tumors compared with V600E tumors. We found that c-Kit protein and KIT gene expressions were significantly higher in V600K tumors than in V600E tumors, concurrent with significant downregulation of several KIT-targeting microRNAs (mir) including mir-222 in V600K tumors, suggesting KIT and mir-222 might be key genomic contributors toward the clinical differences observed. The relationship that we uncovered among KIT/c-Kit expression, mir-222 expression, and growth and prosurvival signals in V600 tumors is intriguing. We believe that the observed clinical aggressiveness of V600K tumors compared to V600E tumors may be attributable to the increased energy metabolism, protein translation and prosurvival signals compared with V600E tumors. If confirmed using larger numbers of V600K tumors, our results may prove useful for designing clinical management and targeted chemotherapeutical interventions for BRAF V600K-positive melanomas.

Accumulating evidence has established that microRNAs (miRNAs) can play a critical role in tumor initiation, progression and metastasis including cSCC. Abnormal expression of hsa-miR-142-5p has been elaborated in various tumors. Nevertheless, its expression and function in the development of cSCC remain unclear. In our study, we found that the expression of hsa-miR-142-5p in cSCC cells were greatly overexpressed compared to human benign epidermal keratinocyte cells. Moreover, inhibited hsa-miR-142-5p can repress cSCC cell growth and induce apoptosis while upregulated hsa-miR-142-5p exhibited a reverse phenomenon. Recently, cancer stem cells (CSCs) which possess the ability of self-renewal and proliferation and are able to produce cancer cells have been widely reported. However, the correlation between hsa-miR-142-5p and CSCs in cSCC is still unknown. Interestingly, we observed that overexpressing hsa-miR-142-5p can induce CSC-like properties in cSCC via activating Wnt signaling. In addition, the luciferase reporter assay data and bioinformatics analysis demonstrated that hsa-miR-142-5p can target the 3'UTR of PTEN mRNA.

We studied the connection via population-based Finnish register data. All women with the diagnosis of LP (n=13,100) were identified from the Finnish Hospital Discharge Registry from 1969-2012. These patients were linked with subsequent cancer diagnoses from the Finnish Cancer Registry until 2014. Standardized Incidence Ratios (SIRs) were counted for different cancers by dividing the observed numbers of cancers by expected numbers, which were based on national cancer incidence rates. In total, 1,520 women with LP were diagnosed with cancer (SIR 1.15, 95% CI 1.09-1.20). LP was associated with an increased risk of cancer of lip (SIR 5.17, 95% CI 3.06-8.16), cancer of tongue (SIR 12.4, 95% CI 9.45-16.0), cancer of oral cavity (SIR 7.97, 95% CI 6.79-9.24), cancer of oesophagus (SIR 1.95, 95% CI 1.17-3.04), cancer of larynx (SIR of 3.47, 95% CI 1.13-8.10) and cancer of vulva (SIR 1.99, 95% CI 1.18-3.13).

CD-DST allows for the analysis of a smaller number of cells compared with other anticancer drug sensitivity tests. The present study reported a successful analysis of anticancer drug sensitivity using CD-DST on cervical lymph node tissue dissected following neoadjuvant chemotherapy from a 55-year-old man with advanced hard palate cancer. Tumor resection and bilateral neck dissection were performed following neoadjuvant chemotherapy (docetaxel + cisplatin + 5-fluorouracil; TPF) for hard palate cancer T2N2cM0. Local recurrence and cervical multiple skin metastasis occurred ~8 months after surgery, and the patient received six doses of cetuximab (C-mab) + cisplatin + 5-fluorouracil (C-mab + PF) administration, which is a type of molecular-targeted therapy. Following the use of the CD-DST method, the clinical response was noted as stable disease following execution of TPF and partial response following execution of C-mab + PF. In addition, low sensitivity by TPF and high sensitivity by C-mab + PF were reported.

The gene product CLOCK is a core molecular component of the circadian oscillator, so that mice with a mutated Clock gene (Clk/Clk) exhibit abnormal rhythms in various physiological processes. However, we demonstrated here that Clk/Clk mice resisted chemical carcinogen-induced tumorigenesis by suppressing epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor-mediated proliferation signals. The repetitive application of 7,12-dimethylbenz[α]anthracene (DMBA) to skin on the back resulted in the significant development of tumors in wild-type mice, whereas chemically-induced tumorigenesis was alleviated in Clk/Clk mice. Although the degree of DMBA-induced DNA damage was not significantly different between wild-type and Clk/Clk mice, EGF receptor-mediated Ras activation was not detected in DMBA-treated Clk/Clk mice. Genetic and biochemical experiments revealed that the suppression of EGF receptor-mediated signal transduction in DMBA-treated Clk/Clk mice was associated with the expression of the cellular senescence factor p16INK4a.

She had distant metastasis to the lung. An MRI revealed a 25-cm shoulder mass involving the proximal arm muscles with encasement of the axillary artery, vein, and brachial plexus. A palliative forequarter amputation was performed and tumor thrombus was evident within the axillary artery and vein. Postoperatively, she developed an acute onset of dyspnea and hypoxia. A computed tomography scan revealed a pulmonary saddle embolism. A bilateral lower extremity venous duplex was negative. She became hemodynamically unstable despite resuscitation and was placed on vasopressor support. A transthoracic echocardiogram revealed elevated pulmonary artery pressure, tricuspid regurgitation, right heart dilation, and reduced right heart systolic function consistent with acute cor pulmonale. The patient did not want to pursue a median sternotomy with pulmonary artery embolectomy and expired from cardiopulmonary arrest within 24 h of the operation.

Recently, next generation sequencing analysis revealed that TP63 mutations are frequent, specifically in cutaneous melanomas. Cutaneous melanoma represents 4% of skin cancers but it is responsible for 80% of skin cancer related deaths. In the present study, we first determined whether all three members of the P53 family of transcription factors were found mutated in cutaneous melanomas by retrieving all TP53, TP63 and TP73 mutations from cBioPortal (http://www.cbioportal.org/). TP53 and TP63 were frequently mutated [15.0% (91/605) and 14.7% (89/605), respectively], while TP73 [1.5% (9/605)] was more rarely mutated (p&lt;0.0001). A UV-mutation fingerprint was recognized for TP63 and TP73 genes. Then, we tried to evaluate the potential role of TP63 mutations as drivers or passengers in the tumorigenic process. In the former case, the amino acid substitutions should cause significant functional consequences on the main biochemical activity of the P63 protein, namely transactivation. The predicted effects of specific amino acid substitutions by two bioinformatics tools were rather different. Using a yeast-based functional assay, the observed hotspot mutant R379CP63 protein exhibited a substantial residual activity compared to the wild-type (&gt;70%). This result does not support a major role of the mutant P63 protein in melanomagenesis while it is still consistent with the TP63 gene being a recorder of UV exposure. The TP63 mutation spectrum from cutaneous melanomas, when compared with that observed at the germinal level in patients affected by P63-associated diseases [ectodermal dysplasia syndromes, (EDs)], revealed significant differences. The TP63 mutations were more frequent at CpGs sites (p&lt;0.0001) in EDs and at PyPy sites (p&lt;0.0001) in cutaneous melanomas. The two spectra differed significantly (p&lt;0.0001).

We identified and characterized miR-15a-5p and miR-25-3p as negative regulators of hnRNPA1 expression, which is required for the processing of miR-18a-3p, an inhibitor of the <i>K-RAS</i> oncogene. The inhibition of miR-25-3p and miR-15a-5p decreased the proliferation, motility, invasiveness and angiogenic potential and increased apoptosis when combined with docetaxel. Alteration of this regulatory circuit causes poor overall survival outcome in ovarian cancer patients. These results highlight miR-15a-5p and miR-25-3p as key regulators of miR-18a-3p expression and its downstream target <i>K-RAS</i>, through direct modulation of hnRNPA1 expression. Our results demonstrate the therapeutic potential of inhibiting miR-25-3p and miR-15a-5p and the use of miR-18a-3p/KRAS ratio as a prominent outcome prognostic factor.</abstracttext>]",|,"['K-RAS', 'RNA-binding proteins', 'chemotherapy resistance', 'hnRNPA1', 'microRNAs', 'ovarian cancer']",|,"['Department of Experimental Therapeutics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Center for RNA Interference and Non-Coding RNA, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Instituto de Investiga\xc3\xa7\xc3\xa3o e Inova\xc3\xa7\xc3\xa3o em Sa\xc3\xbade/Institute for Research and Innovation in Health (I3S) and Instituto de Engenharia Biom\xc3\xa9dica (INEB), University of Porto, Porto, Portugal.', 'Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Faculty of Pharmacy, The University of Al-Azhar, Cairo, Egypt.', 'Center for Research and Advanced Studies, National Polytechnic Institute (CINVESTAV del IPN), Monterrey, Mexico.', 'Department of Gynecologic Oncology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.']",|,[]

Materials and Methods In this HIPAA-compliant, institutional review board-approved retrospective cohort study, an institutional database was searched for abdominal and pelvic CT studies performed between June 2003 and December 2010 in women reported to have adnexal cysts. Adnexal cyst characterization was determined by prospective report description as well as image review by a research fellow and by a fellowship-trained abdominal radiologist for examinations with disagreement between the original report and the research fellow's assessment. Patients with known ovarian cysts or ovarian cancer at time of the index CT examination were excluded. Clinical outcome was assessed by using follow-up imaging studies, medical records, and the state cancer registry. Benign outcome was determined by benign findings at surgery, a decrease in size or resolution of a simple-appearing cyst at follow-up imaging, or stability of the cyst for at least 1 year. Descriptive statistics and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. Results Among 42 111 women who underwent abdominal and pelvic CT examinations in the study period, 2763 (6.6%; 95% CI: 6.3%, 6.8%) (mean age, 48.1 years ± 18.1; range, 15-102 years) had a newly detected finding of ovarian cyst described in the body or impression section of the report. Median cyst size was 3.1 cm (range, 0.8-20.0 cm). Eighteen (0.7%; 95% CI: 0.4%, 1.0%) of 2763 patients were found to have ovarian cancer after an average follow-up of 5.1 years ± 3.8 (range, 0-12.8 years).

However, in many tumor types, development of resistance of cancer cells and cytotoxicity in normal tissues presents a major therapeutic problem. It is therefore crucial to identify and develop novel sensitizing agents that may improve the response to radiation therapy without causing any adverse effects. The present study aimed to investigate whether paeonol, a bioactive flavonoid, was able to confer sensitivity to radiation in human ovarian cancer cells. The human ovarian cancer cell lines SKOV-3 and OVCAR-3 were exposed to varying doses of radiation (2, 4 or 6 Gy) in the presence or absence of paeonol (25, 50 or 100 µM). Radiosensitivity was assessed by measuring cell viability using a CCK-8 assay and Annexin V/PI staining.

Steroid hormones, such as estradiol, are perceived as having a negative impact on consumer health. This internationally shared opinion has led to a ban on the use of steroid hormones in food producing animals in many countries (i.e., European Union, New Zealand, and Australia). Letrozole, a non-steroidal aromatase inhibitor, inactivates the aromatase enzyme responsible for the synthesis of estrogens by reversibly binding to the ""heme"" group of the P450 subunit. Letrozole is approved as an adjuvant or first-line treatment for hormone-dependent breast cancer in post-menopausal women, but has been used increasingly for ovulation induction in the treatment of infertility in women. Using the bovine model to determine the effects on ovarian function, letrozole treatment was found to extend the lifespan of the dominant follicle and thereby delay emergence of the next follicle wave and/or ovulation. Letrozole treatment also had a luteotrophic effect; that is, larger CL and/or higher circulating concentrations of progesterone were detected in letrozole-treated heifers. Results of the initial studies in cattle provided the impetus for the development of aromatase inhibitor-based synchronization and fertility treatment in cattle. Biologically active concentrations of letrozole were achieved via intravenous, intramuscular or intravaginal administration, but the intravaginal route of administration is of particular interest because it permits extended and defined treatment periods, is minimally invasive, and reduces animal handling. Recent results revealed that irrespective of the stage of the cycle, a 4-day letrozole-based protocol induced ovulation in a significantly greater proportion of animals and with significantly greater synchrony than the control treatment. Evidence and reasons for the increasing use of programmed breeding and fixed-time artificial insemination are discussed in this review as a background to current development of an innovative aromatase inhibitor-based protocol as a safe and effective method of controlling the estrous cycle and ovulation in cattle.</abstracttext>]",|,"['Aromatase inhibitor', 'Cattle', 'Estradiol', 'Letrozole', 'Ovulation', 'Synchronization']",|,"['Institute of Veterinary, Animal and Biomedical Sciences, Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand.

Ovarian carcinoma immunoreactive antigen-like protein 2 (OCIAD2) has been found frequently methylated in various cancers, including HCC. The aim of the present study was to investigate the role of OCIAD2 in HCC progression. We analyzed liver hepatocellular carcinoma patients' data from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), including data extracted from 371 HCC tissues and 50 adjacent normal liver tissues. The RNA sequencing and DNA methylation data revealed that OCIAD2 were significantly hypermethylated and its expression level in the tumor tissues was much lower than that in the corresponding adjacent normal tissues. The methylation level in the promoter was negatively correlated with the expression level of OCAID2. Treatment of HCC cell lines with the DNA methylation inhibitor 5-aza-2'-deoxycitydine (5-Aza) induced a significant increase in the OCIAD2 mRNA and protein. Knocking-down OCIAD2 led to an increased colony formation, migration and invasion dramatically, accompanying with an enhanced expression of MMP9 and activation of AKT and FAK. Inhibition of AKT signaling restored OCIAD2-mediated changes in HCC cell clonogenic growth, migration and invasion. Survival analysis of HCC patient's data indicated patients with a higher expression ratio of OCIAD2/MMP9 had a shorter overall survival than those with a lower expression ratio of OCIAD2/MMP9. Overall, our data indicate that reduced expression of OCIAD2 by DNA hypermethylation plays an important role in HCC tumor growth and invasion.

The present study, conducted on two human HER2-overexpressing EOC cell lines - SKOV3 and its <i>in vivo</i>-passaged SKOV3.ip cell variant characterized by enhanced <i>in vivo</i> tumorigenicity - and on SKOV3.ip xenografts implanted in SCID mice, showed: a) about 2-fold higher PC-PLC and HER2 protein expression levels in SKOV3.ip compared to SKOV3 cells; b) physical association of PC-PLC with HER2 in non-raft domains; c) HER2 internalization and ca. 50% reduction of HER2 mRNA and protein expression levels in SKOV3.ip cells exposed to the PC-PLC inhibitor tricyclodecan-9-yl-potassium xanthate (D609); d) differential effects of D609 and trastuzumab on HER2 protein expression and cell proliferation; e) decreased <i>in vivo</i> tumor growth in SKOV3.ip xenografts during <i>in vivo</i> treatment with D609; f) potential use of <i>in vivo</i> magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) and imaging (MRI) parameters as biomarkers of EOC response to PC-PLC inhibition. Overall, these findings support the view that PC-PLC inhibition may represent an effective means to target the tumorigenic effects of HER2 overexpression in EOC and that <i>in vivo</i> MR approaches can efficiently monitor its effects.</abstracttext>]",|,"['HER2 overexpression', 'magnetic resonance imaging', 'magnetic resonance spectroscopy', 'ovarian cancer', 'phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipase C']",|,"['Department of Cell Biology and Neurosciences, Istituto Superiore di Sanit\xc3\xa0, 00161, Roma, Italy.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Molecular Medicine, Istituto Superiore di Sanit\xc3\xa0, 00161, Roma, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental Oncology and Molecular Medicine, Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori, 20133, Milano, Italy.', 'Department of Histology, University of Medicine and Pharmacy ""Grigore T.

Interactions of mesothelin, a 40-kDa cell surface glycoprotein, with cancer antigen 125 (CA125) is associated with drug resistance, metastasis, and poor clinical outcome of ovarian cancer patients. In this study, we examined the role of TLR5 and TLR7 in the metastasis of ovarian cancer through the induction of mesothelin/CA125 expression and investigated its underlying mechanism. TLR5 agonist (flagellin) and TLR7 agonist (imiquimod) upregulated mesenchymal phenotypes and produced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related cytokines in the SKOV3 cells; however, TLR7 expressing CaOV3 cells had no response to the specific ligand, imiquimod, for enhancing its EMT processes. Stimulation of the SKOV3 cells with flagellin or imiquimod activated Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein verprolin-homologous 3 (WAVE3) and mesothelin/CA125, whereas it suppressed the expression of TAp63. Moreover, knockdown of TLR5 or TLR7 in SKOV3 cells profoundly impaired the TLR5- or TLR7-intiated downstream signaling pathway. Loss of WAVE3 in SKOV3 cells led to the inhibition of invasion, suppression of mesenchymal characteristics, prevention of OCT4/SOX2 secretion, and attenuation of mesothelin/CA125 expression after stimulation with flagellin or imiquimod. Although the disruption of mesothelin decreased the migratory activity of the TLR5/7-activated SKOV3 cells, knockdown of mesothelin failed to reduce the expression of mesenchymal markers, OCT4, and SOX2. In addition, targeting OCT4 or SOX2 with siRNA had no effect on the expression of mesothelin and the suppression of transcriptionally active p63 (TAp63) in the TLR5/7-stimulated SKOV3 cells. Our results suggest that TLR5/7-mediated WAVE3 activation not only controls the mesothelin-related EMT processes but also modulates OCT4/SOX2-mediated mesenchymal marker expression.

Current study was aimed to investigate the biological functions of lncRNA MALAT1 and miR-200c, as well as the interaction between them. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) showed that lncRNA MALAT1 was overexpressed in ovarian cancer tissues and cell lines in compare to adjacent normal tissue and normal human ovarian surface epithelial cells (HOSEPiCs). Contrarily, miR-200c expression was significantly decreased in ovarian cancer, which is negatively correlated with MALAT1 expression. In addition, overexpression of lncRNA MALAT1 appeared to be related to worse prognosis and higher metastasis. In consistent with clinical outcomes, down-regulation of lncRNA MALAT1 suppressed the cell viability, migration and invasion abilities of ovarian cancer cell lines. Moreover, bioinformatics analysis suggested that3'-UTR of lncRNA MALAT1 and miR-200c have a complementarity region. Rescue experiments confirmed that miR-200c could reverse the tumor-suppressive effect of knock-down of lncRNA MALAT1 on ovarian cancer cells. Nevertheless, luciferase assays verified the existence of direct binding between miR-200c and lncRNA MALAT1. In general, results of this study indicated that lncRNA MALAT1 is a oncogene in ovarian cancer, involved in the regulation of cell viability, migration and invasion abilities of ovarian cancer cells, which achieved its biological function by regulating miR-200c expression.

In the present study, we describe a unique case of synchronous BBC in a 59-year-old previously healthy woman with no known family history of breast or ovarian cancer. At the time of diagnosis the patient had an invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) in the right breast and an adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) in the left breast. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first published case of bilateral, simultaneously occurring ACC and ILC of the breast. Genome-wide genomic profiling of the tumors revealed that they had distinctly different genomic imbalances. The ACC had a 5.7 Mb interstitial 6q deletion with a breakpoint located in the 3'-part of <i>MYB</i>, resulting in loss of the last coding exon of <i>MYB</i> and its 3'-UTR. RT-PCR analysis confirmed that the tumor expressed an ACC-specific <i>MYB-NFIB</i> fusion transcript.

The induction of anoikis requires the lysosomal-mediated downregulation of epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFRs) leading to termination of pro-survival signaling. In this study, we demonstrate that depletion of pre-mRNA splicing factor 4 kinase (PRP4K; also known as PRPF4B) causes dysregulation of EGFR trafficking and anoikis resistance. We also report a novel cytoplasmic localization of PRP4K at the late endosome, and demonstrate both nuclear and cytoplasmic localization in breast, lung and ovarian cancer tissue. Mechanistically, depletion of PRP4K leads to reduced EGFR degradation following cell detachment from the ECM and correlates with increased TrkB, vimentin and Zeb1 expression. As a result, PRP4K loss promotes sustained growth factor signaling and increased cellular resistance to anoikis in vitro and in a novel zebrafish xenotransplantation model of anoikis sensitivity, as well as increased metastasis in a mouse model of ovarian cancer. Thus, PRP4K may serve as a potential biomarker of anoikis sensitivity in ovarian and other epithelial cancers.Oncogene advance online publication, 11 September 2017; doi:10.1038/onc.2017.318.</abstracttext>]",|,[],|,"['Department of Biochemistry &amp;Molecular Biology, Dalhousie University, Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada.', 'Department of Pathology, Dalhousie University, Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Dalhousie University, Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada.', ""Centre de recherche du Centre hospitalier de l'Universit\xc3\xa9 de Montr\xc3\xa9al (CRCHUM) and Institut du cancer de Montr\xc3\xa9al, Montreal, Quebec, Canada."", 'D\xc3\xa9partement de m\xc3\xa9decine, Universit\xc3\xa9 de Montr\xc3\xa9al, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Department of Pediatrics, IWK Health Centre, Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada.', 'Beatrice Hunter Cancer Research Institute, Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Dalhousie University, Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada.']",|,['http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/onc.2017.318']

In this study, we sought to explore the potential functions of miR-219-5p in epithelial ovarian cancer.

The European Pollutant Release and Transfer Register (E-PRTR) has made it possible to study exposure to industrial pollution. This study seeks to describe the industrial emissions in the vicinity of Spanish towns and their temporal changes, and review our experience studying industrial pollution and cancer. Data on industrial pollutant sources (2007-2010) were obtained from the E-PRTR registries. Population exposure was estimated by the distance from towns to industrial facilities. We calculated the amount of carcinogens emitted into the air in the proximity (&lt;5km) of towns and show them in municipal maps. We summarized the most relevant results and conclusions reported by ecological E-PRTR-based on studies of cancer mortality and industrial pollution in Spain and the limitations and result interpretations of these types of studies. There are high amounts of carcinogen emissions in the proximity of towns in the southwest, east and north of the country and the total amount of emitted carcinogens is considerable (e.g. 20Mt of arsenic, 63Mt of chromium and 9Mt of cadmium). Although the emissions of some carcinogens in the proximity of certain towns were reduced during the study period, emissions of benzene, dioxins+furans and polychlorinated biphenyls rose. Moreover, the average population of towns lying within a 5km radius from emission sources of carcinogens included in the International Agency for Research on Cancer list of carcinogens was 9 million persons. On the other hand, the results of the reviewed studies suggest that those Spanish regions exposed to the pollution released by certain types of industrial facilities have around 17% cancer excess mortality when compared with those unexposed. Moreover, excess mortality is focused on digestive and respiratory tract cancers, leukemias, prostate, breast and ovarian cancers. Despite their limitations, ecological studies are a useful tool in environmental epidemiology, not only for proposing etiological hypotheses about the risk of living close to industrial pollutant sources, but also for providing data to account for situations of higher mortality in specific areas. Nevertheless, the reduction of emissions should be a goal, with special relevance given to establishing limits for known carcinogens and other toxic substances in the environs of population centers, as well as industry-specific emission limits.</abstracttext>]",|,"['Cancer', 'Epidemiology', 'Industrial pollution', 'Mortality']",|,"['Cancer and Environmental Epidemiology Unit, National Center for Epidemiology, Carlos III Institute of Health, Avda.

In this report we sought to establish if ascites can determine the efficiency of transmesothelial invasion of ovarian cancer cells, and, if so, whether the fluid generated by highly aggressive serous and undifferentiated tumors will promote the invasion more effectively than ascites from less aggressive clear cell and endometrioid cancers. The study showed that the invasion of ovarian cancer cells (SKOV-3 and primary cancer cells) across monolayered peritoneal mesothelial cells was elevated upon mesothelial cell exposure to fluid produced by serous and undifferentiated cancers, as compared with cells subjected to ascites from clear cell and endometrioid tumors. This effect coincided with decreased mesothelial expression of junctional proteins: connexin 43, E-cadherin, occludin, and desmoglein. Moreover, it was accompanied by transforming growth factor β1-dependent overproduction of reactive oxygen species by these cells. The activity of ascites from serous and undifferentiated tumors was mediated by p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase and nuclear factor κB. When the mesothelial cells were protected against oxidative stress, both deterioration of junctional proteins and intensification of cancer cell invasion in response to ascites from serous and undifferentiated tumors were effectively prevented. In conclusion, our findings indicate that the high aggressiveness of some histotypes of ovarian cancer may be related to the ability of malignant ascites generated by these cells to oxidative stress-dependent impairment of mesothelial cell integrity and the resulting increase in their transmesothelial invasion.</abstracttext>]",|,"['Intercellular junctions', 'Invasion', 'Malignant ascites', 'Ovarian cancer', 'Peritoneal mesothelium']",|,"['Department of Hypertensiology, Angiology and Internal Medicine, Pozna\xc5\x84 University of Medical Sciences, D\xc5\x82uga 1/2 Str., 61-848 Pozna\xc5\x84, Poland.

A number of factors aid the migration and invasion of malignant cancer cells. Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), which greatly facilitates the dissemination of cancer cells, is characterized by the loss of epithelial markers and the acquisition of mesenchymal markers thereby rendering the cells more migratory and invasive. We have previously shown that the class III lysine deacetylase SIRT1 plays a critical role curbing the metastasis of ovarian cancer cells partly by blocking EMT. Here we investigated the mechanism by which SIRT1 regulates the transcription of Claudin 5 (CLDN5), an epithelial marker gene, in ovarian cancer cells. SIRT1 activation or over-expression up-regulated CLDN5 expression while SIRT1 inhibition or depletion down-regulated CLDN5 expression. SIRT1 interacted with and deacetylated Kruppel-like factor 4 (KLF4), a known transcriptional activator for CLDN5. Deacetylation by SIRT1 promoted nuclear accumulation of KLF4 and enhanced the binding of KLF4 on the CLDN5 promoter in the nucleus. SIRT1-mediated up-regulation of CLDN5 was abrogated in the absence of KLF4. In accordance, KLF4 depletion by siRNA rendered ovarian cancer cells more migratory and invasive despite of SIRT1 activation or over-expression.

Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) restore and augment the antitumor immune activities of cytotoxic T cells by mainly blocking immune checkpoint molecules on T cells or their ligands on antigen-presenting and tumor cells. Based on preclinical data, many clinical trials have demonstrated the acceptable safety profiles and efficacies of mAb in various cancers. The A first-in-class approved immune checkpoint inhibitor is ipilimumab, which is a fully humanized mAb that blocks the immunosuppressive signal by cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4. In 2011, the US Food and Drug Administration approved the use of ipilimumab for the treatment of advanced metastatic melanoma. Then, nivolumab, which is a humanized mAb that blocks programmed death-1 (PD-1), was approved for use in the treatment of advanced melanoma in 2014 and of advanced non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) in 2015 in Japan. Pembrolizumab, which is another anti-PD-1 antibody, was approved for use in the treatment of advanced melanoma and advanced NSCLC as the first-line therapy in 2016 in Japan. Thereafter, nivolumab was also approved for use in the treatment of advanced renal cell cancer in August 2016, of Hodgkin's lymphoma in December 2016, and of head and neck cancer in March 2017 in Japan.

Knowledge of her BRCA status has value both for the woman and for her family. A therapeutic benefit exists for the woman with cancer, because a new family of oral drugs, the poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitors, has recently been approved, and these drugs have the greatest efficacy in women who carry the mutation. For her family, there is the potential to prevent ovarian cancer in those carrying the mutation by using risk-reducing surgery. Such surgery significantly reduces the chance of developing this, for the most part, incurable cancer. Despite these potential benefits, referral rates for genetic counseling and subsequent BRCA testing are low, ranging from 10% to 30%, indicating that these therapeutic and prevention opportunities are being missed. The authors have reviewed the relevant available literature. Topics discussed are BRCA and its relation to ovarian cancer, the rates of referral for genetic counseling/BRCA testing, reasons for these low rates, potential strategies to improve on those rates, lack of effectiveness of current screening strategies, the pros and cons of risk-reducing surgery, other prevention options, and the role and value of PARP inhibitors.

The arrays are among the most variable segments of the genome, exhibit concerted copy number variation (cCNV), encode essential components of the ribosome, and modulate global gene expression. Here we combined whole genome data from &gt;700 tumors and paired normal tissues to provide a portrait of rDNA variation in human tissues and cancers of diverse mutational signatures, including stomach and lung adenocarcinomas, ovarian cancers, and others of the TCGA panel. We show that cancers undergo coupled 5S rDNA array expansion and 45S rDNA loss that is accompanied by increased estimates of proliferation rate and nucleolar activity. These somatic changes in rDNA CN occur in a background of over 10-fold naturally occurring rDNA CN variation across individuals and cCNV of 5S-45S arrays in some but not all tissues. Analysis of genetic context revealed associations between cancer rDNA CN amplification or loss and the presence of specific somatic alterations, including somatic SNPs and copy number gain/losses in protein coding genes across the cancer genome. For instance, somatic inactivation of the tumor suppressor gene TP53 emerged with a strong association with coupled 5S expansion / 45S loss in several cancers. Our results uncover frequent and contrasting changes in the 5S and 45S rDNA along rapidly proliferating cell lineages with high nucleolar activity. We suggest that 5S rDNA amplification facilitates increased proliferation, nucleolar activity, and ribosomal synthesis in cancer, whereas 45S rDNA loss emerges as a byproduct of transcription-replication conflict in rapidly replicating tumor cells. The observations raise the prospects of using the rDNA arrays as re-emerging targets for the design of novel strategies in cancer therapy.</abstracttext>]",|,[],|,"['Department of Environmental Health &amp; Molecular and Integrative Physiological Sciences program, Harvard T.

Modulation of Wnt and BMP signaling directed iPSC differentiation into Müllerian cells and subsequent use of pro-Müllerian growth factors promoted FTE precursors. The expression and localization of Müllerian markers verified correct cellular differentiation. An innovative 3D growth platform, which enabled the FTE organoid to self-organize into a convoluted luminal structure, permitted matured differentiation to a FTE lineage.
