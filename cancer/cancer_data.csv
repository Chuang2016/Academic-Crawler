AZD8835 is a PI3K inhibitor, with selectivity against PI3K α and δ isoforms, which is currently in Phase 1 clinical trials. 18F-Fluoro-deoxy-glucose positron emission tomography (18F-FDG PET) is a non-invasive pharmacodynamic imaging biomarker that has become an integral part of drug development. It has been used widely with PI3K inhibitors both clinically and pre-clinically because of the role of the PI3K pathway in glucose metabolism. In this study we investigated the potential of 18F-FDG PET as a non-invasive pharmacodynamic biomarker for AZD8835. We sought to understand if 18F-FDG PET could determine the minimally effective dose of AZD8835 and correlate with other pharmacodynamic biomarkers for validation of its use in clinical development. 18F-FDG PET scans were performed in nude mice in the BT474C breast xenograft model. Mice were fasted prior to imaging and static 18F-FDG PET was performed. Treatment groups received AZD8835 by oral gavage at a dose volume of 10ml/kg. Treatment groups received either 3, 6, 12.5, 25 or 50mg/kg AZD8835. Tumour growth was monitored throughout the study, and at the end of the imaging procedure, tumours were taken and a full pharmacodynamic analysis was performed.</abstracttext>, <abstracttext label=""RESULTS"" nlmcategory=""RESULTS"">Results showed that AZD8835 reduced 18F-FDG uptake at a dose of 12.5, 25 and 50mg/kg with no significant reduction at doses of 3 and 6mg/kg. These results were consistent with other pharmacodynamics biomarkers measured and show 18F-FDG PET as a sensitive biomarker with the ability to determine the minimal effective dose of AZD8835.</abstracttext>, <abstracttext label=""CONCLUSIONS"" nlmcategory=""CONCLUSIONS"">Our pre-clinical studies support the use of 18F-FDG PET imaging as a sensitive and non- invasive pharmacodynamic biomarker (understanding the role of PI3K signalling in glucose uptake) for AZD8835 with a decrease in 18F-FDG uptake observed at only two hours post treatment. The decrease in 18F-FDG uptake was dose dependent and data showed excellent PK/PD correlation. This data supports and parallels observations obtained with this class of compounds in patients.</abstracttext>]",['http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0183048']

However, thioridazine alone does not induce apoptosis in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (AMC-HN4), human breast carcinoma (MDA-MB231), and human glioma (U87MG) cells. Therefore, we investigated whether combined treatment with thioridazine and curcumin induces apoptosis. Combined treatment with thioridazine and curcumin markedly induced apoptosis in cancer cells without inducing apoptosis in human normal mesangial cells and human normal umbilical vein cells (EA.hy926). We found that combined treatment with thioridazine and curcumin had synergistic effects in AMC-HN4 cells. Among apoptosis-related proteins, thioridazine plus curcumin induced down-regulation of c-FLIP and Mcl-1 expression at the post-translational levels in a proteasome-dependent manner. Augmentation of proteasome activity was related to the up-regulation of proteasome subunit alpha 5 (PSMA5) expression in curcumin plus thioridazine-treated cells. Combined treatment with curcumin and thioridazine produced intracellular ROS in a NOX4-dependent manner, and ROS-mediated activation of Nrf2/ARE signaling played a critical role in the up-regulation of PSMA5 expression. Furthermore, ectopic expression of c-FLIP and Mcl-1 inhibited apoptosis in thioridazine and curcumin-treated cells. Therefore, we demonstrated that thioridazine plus curcumin induces proteasome activity by up-regulating PSMA5 expression via NOX4-mediated ROS production and that down-regulation of c-FLIP and Mcl-1 expression post-translationally is involved in apoptosis.</abstracttext>]",['https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2213-2317(17)30290-2']

The diagnosis of hypercalcemia (ie, levels 10.5 mg/dL or greater) should be confirmed with an albumin-adjusted or ionized calcium level. The two most common causes of hypercalcemia are hyperparathyroidism and malignancy. Drugs, notably lithium and thiazide diuretics, also can cause hypercalcemia. Patients with severe or symptomatic hypercalcemia should be treated initially with hydration to decrease calcium levels. The evaluation should include a parathyroid hormone (PTH) level. If the PTH level is low, cancer is a likely cause, particularly multiple myeloma, breast cancer, or lymphoma. If the PTH level is normal or elevated, hyperparathyroidism is the likely cause. Symptomatic patients with hyperparathyroidism and patients with certain clinical markers should be considered for surgery. For patients with mild disease, monitoring is an option. Hypocalcemia often is caused by vitamin D deficiency. Symptomatic patients and patients with calcium levels less than 7.6 mg/dL should be treated with intravenous calcium gluconate; concomitant magnesium deficiency should be addressed.

We present a case of prostatic adenocarcinoma metastasizing to the appendiceal orifice in a 78-year-old male. Our patient had a history of adenocarcinoma of the prostate diagnosed four years prior to presentation. He also had a history of adenocarcinoma of the distal colon 30 years prior which resulted in a partial colectomy and permanent diverting colostomy. Prior to his presentation, follow-up colonoscopies failed to reveal disease progression or additional malignancy. During routine colonoscopy, he was found to have a 2.5 cm polyp near the appendiceal orifice. Histologically the polyp demonstrated colonic mucosa with an infiltration of the lamina propria by individual cells with abundant cytoplasm and round nuclei with prominent nucleoli. The neoplastic cells were strongly positive for PSA and negative for CK7, CK20, and CDX2 supporting a diagnosis of metastatic prostatic adenocarcinoma. Metastatic disease of extracolonic origin arising in a polyp is extremely uncommon, but metastases have been reported to involve breast, ovary, stomach, esophagus, and kidney.

The samples were tested using two independent ELISA kits. Some of the samples were also evaluated using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) for comparison. We found that while the results by ELISA were reproducible, they were not accurate when compared to LC-MS/MS. It is possible that medications or supplements may cross-react with the ELISA reagents and confound the assessment; however, those were often not the reason for the discrepancy. Our results highlight the need for developing novel, reliable, and clinically accessible assays to measure ultra-low estradiol levels to improve care of breast cancer survivors.

Here we report that FOXN3 is a transcriptional repressor that is physically associated with the SIN3A repressor complex in estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) cells. RNA immunoprecipitation-coupled high-throughput sequencing identified that NEAT1, an estrogen-inducible long noncoding RNA, is required for FOXN3 interactions with the SIN3A complex. ChIP-Seq and deep sequencing of RNA genomic targets revealed that the FOXN3-NEAT1-SIN3A complex represses genes including GATA3 that are critically involved in epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). We demonstrated that the FOXN3-NEAT1-SIN3A complex promotes EMT and invasion of breast cancer cells in vitro as well as dissemination and metastasis of breast cancer in vivo. Interestingly, the FOXN3-NEAT1-SIN3A complex transrepresses ER itself, forming a negative-feedback loop in transcription regulation. Elevation of both FOXN3 and NEAT1 expression during breast cancer progression corresponded to diminished GATA3 expression, and high levels of FOXN3 and NEAT1 strongly correlated with higher histological grades and poor prognosis. Our experiments uncovered that NEAT1 is a facultative component of the SIN3A complex, shedding light on the mechanistic actions of NEAT1 and the SIN3A complex.

This study determined the protective role of aqueous extract from Nelumbo nucifera leaves (NLE) against N-diethylnitrosamine (DEN)-induced oxidative stress and hepatocellular carcinogenesis in a sample of Sprague-Dawley rats. NLE was fed orally to rats in which hepatic carcinoma was induced with DEN for 12 weeks. Five groups of 12 rats each were used for the study: Group I (control group) rats received distilled water; Group II rats were induced with DEN; Group III rats were induced with DEN and cotreated with 0.5% NLE; Group IV rats were induced with DEN and cotreated with 1.0% NLE; and Group V rats were induced with DEN and cotreated with 2.0% NLE. Clinical chemistry, organ weight, inflammatory marker, protein expression, enzyme, and antioxidant analyses were conducted. NLE administration to rats resulted in significantly decreased levels of serum alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and albumin, which is indicative of hepatocellular damage, compared with the control group. DEN-induced oxidative stress was inhibited by NLE and this inhibition was paralleled by decreased lipid peroxides and increased glutathione transferase, superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase activity in liver tissues. The status of nonenzymatic antioxidants, such as reduced glutathione, was also found to be increased in NLE-administered rats. Furthermore, NLE decreased tumor size, hepatic Rac1, PKCα, and GSTπ expressions compared with the DEN-only group. Thus, supplementation of NLE reduced the adverse changes that occur because of liver cancer. These results prove that NLE protects against liver carcinogenesis induced because of treatment with DEN through blocking lipid peroxidation, hepatic cell damage, and enhancing the antioxidant defense system.</abstracttext>]",['http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/tox.22434']

Understanding the mechanisms for gliomagenesis, tumor stem/progenitor cell propagation and phenotypic diversity is critical for devising effective and targeted therapy for this lethal disease. The basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor OLIG2, which is universally expressed in gliomas, has emerged as an important player in GBM cell reprogramming, genotoxic resistance, and tumor phenotype plasticity. In an animal model of proneural GBM, elimination of mitotic OLIG2<sup>+</sup> progenitors blocks tumor growth, suggesting that these progenitors are a seeding source for glioma propagation. OLIG2 deletion reduces tumor growth and causes an oligodendrocytic to astrocytic phenotype shift, with PDGFRα down-regulation and reciprocal EGFR signaling up-regulation, underlying alternative pathways in tumor recurrence. In patient-derived glioma stem cells (GSC), knockdown of OLIG2 leads to down-regulation of PDGFRα, while OLIG2 silencing results in a shift from proneural-to-classical gene expression pattern or a proneural-to-mesenchymal transition in distinct GSC cell lines, where OLIG2 appears to regulate EGFR expression in a context-dependent manner. In addition, post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation by a series of protein kinases regulates OLIG2 activity in glioma cell growth and invasive behaviors. In this perspective, we will review the role of OLIG2 in tumor initiation, proliferation and phenotypic plasticity in animal models of gliomas and human GSC cell lines, and discuss the underlying mechanisms in the control of tumor growth and potential therapeutic strategies to target OLIG2 in malignant gliomas.</abstracttext>]",['http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15384101.2017.1361062']

MR-rOEF was determined from separate measurements of T<sub>2</sub> , T<sub>2</sub> * and relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV) employing a multi-parametric approach for quantification of the blood-oxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD) effect. With respect to [<sup>18</sup> F]-FMISO-PET, besides the commonly used late uptake between 120 and 130 min ([<sup>18</sup> F]-FMISO<sub>120-130 min</sub> ), we also analyzed the hypoxia specific uptake rate [<sup>18</sup> F]-FMISO-k<sub>3</sub> , as obtained by pharmacokinetic modeling of dynamic uptake data.

Various oncogenic pathways such as proliferation and evading cell death converge on redox-dependent signaling processes. Nrf2 is a key regulator in these redox-dependent events and operates in cytoprotection, drug metabolism and malignant progression in cancer cells. Here, we show that patients with primary malignant brain tumors (glioblastomas, WHO °IV gliomas, GBM) have a devastating outcome and overall reduced survival when Nrf2 levels are upregulated. Nrf2 overexpression or Keap1 knockdown in glioma cells accelerate proliferation and oncogenic transformation. Further, activation of the Nrf2-Keap1 signaling upregulates xCT (aka SLC7A11 or system X<sub>c</sub><sup>-</sup>) and amplifies glutamate secretion thereby impacting on the tumor microenvironment. Moreover, both fostered Nrf2 expression and conversely Keap1 inhibition promote resistance to ferroptosis. Altogether, the Nrf2-Keap1 pathway operates as a switch for malignancy in gliomas promoting cell proliferation and resistance to cell death processes such as ferroptosis. Our data demonstrate that the Nrf2-Keap1 pathway is critical for cancer cell growth and operates on xCT.

A well-known hallmark of GMB and many other tumours is aerobic glycolysis. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of short nonprotein coding sequences that exert posttranscriptional controls on gene expression and represent critical regulators of aerobic glycolysis in GBM. In GBM, miRNAs regulate the expression of glycolytic genes directly and via the regulation of metabolism-associated tumour suppressors and oncogenic signalling pathways. This review aims to establish links between miRNAs expression levels, the expression of GBM glycolytic regulatory genes, and the malignant progression and prognosis of GBM. In this review, the involvement of 25 miRNAs in the regulation of glycolytic metabolism of GBM is discussed. Seven of these miRNAs have been shown to regulate glycolytic metabolism in other tumour types. Further eight miRNAs, which are differentially expressed in GBM, have also been reported to regulate glycolytic metabolism in other cancer types. Thus, these miRNAs could serve as potential glycolytic regulators in GBM but will require functional validation. As such, the characterisation of these molecular and metabolic signatures in GBM can facilitate a better understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of this disease.</abstracttext>]",['https://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2017/9157370']

Knowledge of the frequencies of locations of LMD on MRI may assist in early detection, help elucidate the process of leptomeningeal spread of cancer and understand how LMD affects the central nervous system. Our goal was to identify intracranial sites of neoplastic LMD predilection on MRI in patients with cytologically-proven LMD. The presence of FLAIR signal hyperintensity and T1-weighted post-contrast enhancement in the sulci of the supratentorial compartment and cerebellum and enhancement of the cranial nerves (CNs), basal cisterns, pituitary stalk, and ependymal surface of the lateral ventricles, as well as the presence of parenchymal metastasis were recorded. Within each imaging sequence, sites were ordered by prevalence and compared using McNemar's test. The study included 270 patients. Positive MRI findings were present in 185/270 (68.5%) patients. FLAIR signal hyperintensity was significantly more common (p≤0.003) in the cerebellum (n=96) and occipital lobe (n=92) relative to the other lobes. Leptomeningeal enhancement was also significantly more common (p≤0.009) in the cerebellum (n=82) and occipital lobe (n=67) relative to the other lobes. Enhancement was most commonly found involving CN VII/VIII and the ependymal surface of the lateral ventricles compared to other sites. Parenchymal metastases were present in 110 (40.1%) of the patients. In conclusion, neoplastic LMD predominantly involves the cerebellum and occipital lobes, CN VII/VIII, and the ependymal lining of the lateral ventricles.

GBM malignancy is driven in part by a population of GBM stem-like cells (GSCs) that exhibit indefinite self-renewal capacity, multipotent differentiation, expression of neural stem cell markers, and resistance to conventional treatments. GSCs are enriched in specialized niche microenvironments that regulate stem phenotypes and support GSC radioresistance. Therefore, identifying GSC-niche interactions that regulate stem phenotypes may present a unique target for disrupting the maintenance and persistence of this treatment resistant population. In this work, we engineered 3D scaffolds from temperature responsive poly(N-isopropylacrylamide-co-Jeffamine M-1000<sup>®</sup> acrylamide), or PNJ copolymers, as a platform for enriching stem-specific phenotypes in two molecularly distinct human patient-derived GSC cell lines. Notably, we observed that, compared to conventional neurosphere cultures, PNJ cultured GSCs maintained multipotency and exhibited enhanced self-renewal capacity. Concurrent increases in expression of proteins known to regulate self-renewal, invasion, and stem maintenance in GSCs (NESTIN, EGFR, CD44) suggest that PNJ scaffolds effectively enrich the GSC population. We further observed that PNJ cultured GSCs exhibited increased resistance to radiation treatment compared to GSCs cultured in standard neurosphere conditions. GSC radioresistance is supported in vivo by niche microenvironments, and this remains a significant barrier to effectively treating these highly tumorigenic cells. Taken in sum, these data indicate that the microenvironment created by synthetic PNJ scaffolds models niche enrichment of GSCs in patient-derived GBM cell lines, and presents tissue engineering opportunities for studying clinically important behaviors such as radioresistance in vitro.</abstracttext>]",['https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0142-9612(17)30313-7']

PLP deficiency in brain, either genetic or acquired, results in severe drug-resistant seizures that respond to vitamin B6 supplementation. The pathogenesis of vitamin B6 deficiency is largely unknown. To shed more light on the metabolic consequences of vitamin B6 deficiency in brain, we performed untargeted metabolomics in vitamin B6-deprived Neuro-2a cells. Significant alterations were observed in a range of metabolites. The most surprising observation was a decrease of serine and glycine, two amino acids that are known to be elevated in the plasma of vitamin B6 deficient patients. To investigate the cause of the low concentrations of serine and glycine, a metabolic flux analysis on serine biosynthesis was performed. The metabolic flux results showed that the de novo synthesis of serine was significantly reduced in vitamin B6-deprived cells. In addition, formation of glycine and 5-methyltetrahydrofolate was decreased. Thus, vitamin B6 is essential for serine de novo biosynthesis in neuronal cells, and serine de novo synthesis is critical to maintain intracellular serine and glycine. These findings suggest that serine and glycine concentrations in brain may be deficient in patients with vitamin B6 responsive epilepsy. The low intracellular 5-mTHF concentrations observed in vitro may explain the favourable but so far unexplained response of some patients with pyridoxine-dependent epilepsy to folinic acid supplementation.</abstracttext>]",['https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10545-017-0061-3']

Balancing the desire for early detection with avoidance of over-diagnosis has led to competing and contradictory guidelines for both practices.

For each of 306 hospital referral regions (HRRs), we calculated rates of PSA screening for men aged ≥68 years, as well as rates of screening mammography for women aged ≥75 years, adjusted for age and race. Additionally, we determined regional rates of ""healthcare intensity"", including spending on tests and procedures, and intensity of end-of-life care.

HRR-level PSA screening rates were independent of screening mammography rates (r=0.06, p=0.31). PSA screening rates were associated with spending on testing and procedures (r=0.42, p&lt;0.0001) and various measures of intensity of EOL care (e.g. r=0.40, p&lt;0.0001 for mechanical ventilator use).

Some clinical and molecular similarities between certain CMT subtypes and breast cancer make them a potential model for the study of the human disease. As misregulated Hippo signaling is thought to play an important role in breast cancer development and also occurs in CMTs, we sought to determine if Hippo represents a valid pharmacological target for the treatment of CMTs. Six CMT cell lines were assessed for their expression of the Hippo pathway effectors YAP and TAZ and for their sensitivity to verteporfin, an inhibitor of YAP-mediated transcriptional coactivation. Four cell lines that expressed YAP (CMT-9, -12, -28, -47) were found to be very sensitive to verteporfin treatment, which killed the cells through induction of apoptosis with ED50 values of 14-79 nM. Conversely, two YAP-negative cell lines (CF-35, CMT-25) were an order of magnitude more resistant to verteporfin. Verteporfin suppressed the expression of YAP/TAZ target genes, particularly CYR61 and CTGF, which play important roles in breast cancer development. Verteporfin was also able to inhibit cell migration and anchorage-independent growth. Likewise, verteporfin efficiently suppressed tumor cell invasiveness in the CMT-28 and -47 lines, but not in CF-35 cells. Together, our findings provide proof of principle that pharmacological targeting of the Hippo pathway compromises the viability and attenuates the malignant behavior of CMT cells. These results will serve as the basis for the development of novel chemotherapeutic approaches for CMTs that could translate to human medicine.</abstracttext>]",[]

Since levels of copper are considerably elevated in tissue, cell and serum during various malignancies, suggesting that cancer cells would be more subject to copper induced oxidative DNA breakage.

Fifty-nine percent of cost conversations were initiated by oncologists (95% CI, 51 to 67), who most commonly brought up costs for antineoplastic agents. By contrast, patients most frequently brought up costs for diagnostic tests. Thirty-eight percent of cost conversations mentioned cost-reducing strategies (95% CI, 30 to 46), which most commonly sought to lower patient costs for endocrine therapies and symptom-alleviating treatments. The three most commonly discussed cost-reducing strategies were: switching to a lower-cost therapy/diagnostic, changing logistics of the intervention, and facilitating copay assistance.</abstracttext>, <abstracttext label=""CONCLUSION"" nlmcategory=""CONCLUSIONS"">We identified cost conversations in approximately one in five breast cancer visits. Cost conversations were mostly oncologist initiated, lasted &lt; 1 minute, and dealt with a wide range of health care expenses. Cost-reducing strategies were mentioned in more than one third of cost conversations and often involved switching antineoplastic agents for lower-cost alternatives or altering logistics of diagnostic tests.</abstracttext>]",[]

Chemoresistance has become an important problem in breast cancer clinics. The identification of new mechanisms affecting chemosensitivity is of great clinical value for the treatment of breast cancer.</abstracttext>, <abstracttext label=""METHODS"" nlmcategory=""METHODS"">The expression levels of chemoresistance-associated long non-coding RNA (CRALA), a newly discovered long non-coding RNA, were measured by quantitative real time-PCR in 79 pre-treatment biopsied primary breast cancer samples. Small interfering RNAs were used to knockdown CRALA expression. The effect of CRALA on chemosensitivity was evaluated using cell growth assay.</abstracttext>, <abstracttext label=""RESULTS"" nlmcategory=""RESULTS"">Non-responding tumors (poor response to chemotherapy, 32 samples) had fourfold higher CRALA expression than responding tumors (good response to chemotherapy, 47 samples). CRALA is upregulated in chemoresistant breast cancer cell lines compared to their parental lines. Silencing of CRALA in chemoresistant breast cancer cells resensitizes the cells to chemotherapy in vitro. Furthermore, univariate and multivariate analysis showed that higher CRALA expression was significantly associated with poor prognosis in 144 breast cancer patients.</abstracttext>, <abstracttext label=""CONCLUSION"" nlmcategory=""CONCLUSIONS"">The study findings indicate that CRALA expression may be an important biomarker for predicting the clinical response to chemotherapy and prognosis in breast cancer patients.

But the activation and function of AMAP1 in breast cancer remain largely unexplored. Here we show that AMAP1 was phosphorylated and translocated to plasma membrane and formed a stable complex with Pyk2 in response to CCL18. Moreover, CCL18-dependent AMAP1 translocation interfered the AMAP1-IKK-β interaction, resulting in nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-Κb)activation. Depletion of AMAP1 expression by RNAi efficiently reversed the CCL18-induced epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) of breast cancer cells and as well as CCL18-induced adhesion, migration and invasion. Strikingly, AMAP1 overexpression was found in breast cancers that had undergone metastasis and was strongly predictive of poor prognosis in breast cancers. Given that AMAP1 mediated CCL18-induce activation of NF-κB and promoted breast cancer metastasis, AMAP1 may represent a therapeutic target for the eradication of breast cancer metastasis.

Patients completed a cosmesis and functional assessment questionnaire, assessing clinicians completed an EORTC (European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer) cosmetic rating questionnaire and photographs were obtained. The photographs were later assessed by a panel of five experts, as well as analysed using the objective pBRA (relative Breast Retraction Assessment) and the BCCT.core (Breast Cancer Conservative Treatment.cosmetic results) computer software. Scores were dichotomised to excellent/good and fair/poor.

Excellent/good scores by clinician-live and patient self-assessments were 93% and 94% respectively (agreement 89%), as compared to 75% and 74% only by BCCT.core and panel assessments respectively (agreement 83%, kappa 0.57). For the pBRA measurements, there was a statistically significant difference (P &lt;0.001) between scores for excellent/good versus fair/poor cosmesis by all four methods.

Part A : the journal of the International Society for Analytical Cytology,"[<abstracttext>Postnatal mammary gland development requires the presence of mammary stem and progenitor cells (MaSC), which give rise to functional milk-secreting cells and regenerate the mammary epithelium with each cycle of lactation. These long-lived, tissue-resident MaSC are also targets for malignant transformation and may be cancer cells-of-origin. Consequently, MaSC are extensively researched in relation to their role and function in development, tissue regeneration, lactation, and breast cancer. The basic structure and function of the mammary gland are conserved among all mammalian species, from the most primitive to the most evolved. However, species vary greatly in their lactation strategies and mammary cancer incidence, making MaSC an interesting focus for comparative research. MaSC have been characterized in mice, to a lesser degree in humans, and to an even lesser degree in few additional mammals. They remain uncharacterized in most mammalian species, including ""ancient"" monotremes, marsupials, wild, and rare species, as well as in common and domestic species such as cats. Identification and comparison of MaSC across a large variety of species, particularly those with extreme lactational adaptations or low mammary cancer incidence, is expected to deepen our understanding of development and malignancy in the mammary gland. Here, we review the current status of MaSC characterization across species, and underline species variations in lactation and mammary cancer through which we may learn about the role of MaSC in these processes. © 2017 International Society for Advancement of Cytometry.</abstracttext>]",[]

Demographics, surgical variables, and reconstruction decisions were analyzed using t tests, Mann-Whitney U tests, and chi-squared tests. Significant (P &lt; .05) variables were included in a multivariable logistic regression model. About 610 patients were analyzed. The median mastectomy specimen weight was 572 g (62-5230 g), which did not correlate with BMI (P = .44). Women who underwent reconstruction had lighter mastectomy specimens, averaging 643 vs 848 g (P &lt; .0001). A regression controlling for ethnicity, insurance status, number of comorbidities, age at mastectomy, cancer stage, BMI, specimen weight, and mastectomy laterality was constructed.

Women with larger breasts were less likely to be reconstructed regardless of their BMI and comorbidities. Larger breasted women may be considered worse prosthetic reconstruction candidates due to increased complications and suboptimal aesthetic outcomes but may find the increased invasiveness and recovery of autologous reconstruction an unattractive alternative. Furthermore, it is possible that surgeons may be less supportive of breast reconstruction for larger breasted women if there are concerns about safety or the aesthetic quality of the result. In the future, qualitative research must be done to determine why more larger breasted women choose not to be reconstructed as well as develop better ways to increase their reconstructive options.</abstracttext>]",[]

The same criteria apply to the therapy of liver metastases. <b>Key Points</b>  · Careful selection of patients proves to be essential for optimum results of MWA. · Interventionists should be familiar with all aspects of complication and rapid assessment of imaging methods in order to evaluate induced damage by thermal ablation. · MWA seems to have some advantages over radiofrequency ablation, like shorter ablation time, less pain, less heat sink effect; however, scientific proof is needed. <b>Citation Format</b> · Vogl TJ, Nour-Eldin A, Hammerstingl RM et al.

An age-, sex-, index year-, and diabetes mellitus (DM)-matched control cohort of 70,124 persons without PLA was selected from the same dataset. Both cohorts were followed up until the end of 2011. The risk of PLC was estimated for both cohorts.The incidence of PLC was nearly 2-fold greater in the PLA group than in the control cohort (29.3 per 10,000 person-years vs. 16.2 per 10,000 person-years). The incidences of HCC and ICC were 1.5- (22.1 per 10,000 person-years vs. 15.0 per 10,000 person-years) and 11-fold greater (6.73 per 10,000 person-years vs. 0.62 per 10,000 person-years), respectively, in the PLA group than in the control cohort.

These synthesized nanoparticles exhibit stability in aqueous solutions and very low cytotoxicity after poly(acryl amide) modification. High cellular uptake efficiency is observed for the folic acid-conjugated MnFe<sub>2</sub> O<sub>4</sub> -NaYF<sub>4</sub> in human esophagus carcinoma cells (Eca-109) due to the upconversion luminescence properties as well as the folate targeting potential. The MnFe<sub>2</sub> O<sub>4</sub> -NaYF<sub>4</sub> also strongly absorbs light in the near-infrared range and rapidly converts to heat energy. It is demonstrated that Eca-109 cells incubated with MnFe<sub>2</sub> O<sub>4</sub> -NaYF<sub>4</sub> are killed with high efficiency after 808 nm laser irradiation. Furthermore, the growth of tumors in mice (grown from Eca-109 cells) is highly inhibited by the photothermal effects of MnFe<sub>2</sub> O<sub>4</sub> -NaYF<sub>4</sub> efficiently.

In contrast, priorities for high-income countries include vascular disease, cancer, diabetes, dementia and mental health disorders as well as chronic inflammatory disorders such as hepatitis B and hepatitis C. Cost-effectiveness analyses are methods for assessing the gains in health relative to the costs of different health interventions. Methods for measuring health outcomes include years of life saved [or lost], quality-adjusted life years [QALYs] and disability-adjusted life years [DALYs]. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio [ICER] measures the cost [usually in US dollars] per life year saved, QALY gained or DALY averted of one intervention relative to another. In low-income countries, approximately 50% of infant deaths [&lt;5years] are caused by gastroenteritis, the major pathogen being rotavirus infection. Rotavirus vaccines appear to be cost-effective but, thus far, have not been widely adopted. In contrast, infant vaccination for hepatitis B is promoted in most countries with a striking reduction in the prevalence of infection in vaccinated individuals. Cost-effectiveness analyses have also been applied to newer and more expensive drugs for hepatitis B and C and to government-sponsored programs for the early detection of hepatocellular, gastric and colorectal cancer.

LCs belong to the subset of leukocytes called dendritic cells. They are present in the epidermis and the pilosebaceous apparatus and monitor the cutaneous environment for changes in homeostasis. During embryogenesis, a wave of yolk-sac macrophages seed the fetal skin. Then, fetal liver monocytes largely replace the yolk-sac macrophages and comprise the majority of adult LCs. In the presence of skin irritation, LCs process antigen and travel to regional lymph nodes to present antigen to reactive T lymphocytes. Changes in LCs' surface markers during the journey occur under the influence of cytokines. The difference in expression of surface markers and the ability to resist radiation have allowed researchers to differentiate LCs from the murine Langerin-positive dermal dendritic cells. Exciting discoveries have been made recently regarding their role in inflammatory skin diseases, cancer, and HIV. New research has shown that antibodies blocking CD1a appear to mitigate inflammation in contact hypersensitivity reactions and psoriasis. While it has been established that LCs have the potential to induce effector cells of the adaptive immune system to counter oncogenesis, recent studies have demonstrated that LCs coordinate with natural killer cells to impair development of squamous cell carcinoma caused by chemical carcinogens. However, LCs may also physiologically suppress T cells and permit keratinocyte transformation and tumorigenesis. Although long known to play a primary role in the progression of HIV infection, it is now understood that LCs also possess the ability to restrict the progression of the disease. There is a pressing need to discover more about how these cells affect various aspects of health and disease; new information gathered thus far seems promising and exciting.

However, the therapeutic effect of sorafenib is transient and patients invariably develop sorafenib resistance (SR). Recently, TYRO3, a member of the TAM family of receptor tyrosine kinases, was identified as being aberrantly expressed in a significant proportion of HCC, however its role in SR is unknown. In this study, we generated two functionally distinct sorafenib resistant human Huh-7 HCC cell lines, in order to identify new mechanisms to abrogate acquired SR, as well as new potential therapeutic targets in HCC. Initially, we investigated the effects of a microRNA, miR-7, in both in vitro and in vivo preclinical models of human HCC and identified miR-7 as a potent tumour suppressor of human HCC. We identified TYRO3 as a new functional target of miR-7, which regulates proliferation, migration and invasion of Huh-7 cells via the PI3-Kinase/AKT pathway and is markedly elevated upon acquisition of SR. Furthermore, miR-7 effectively silenced TYRO3 expression in both sorafenib-sensitive and sorafenib-resistant Huh-7 cells inhibiting TYRO3/GAS6 mediated cancer cell migration and invasion. In conclusion, we identified a novel mechanism for acquiring SR in HCC which is via the aberrant expression of the TYRO3/PI3-Kinase/AKT signal transduction pathway, a mechanism that can be overcome by miR-7 over-expression.

Many studies have shown that insulin resistance is a risk factor for HCC. We previously discovered the overexpression and oncogenic role of the Reptin/RUVBL2 ATPase in HCC. Here, we found that Reptin silencing enhanced insulin sensitivity in 2 HCC cell lines, as shown by a large potentiation of insulin-induced AKT phosphorylation on Ser473 and Thr308, and of downstream signalling. Reptin silencing did not affect the tyrosine phosphorylation of the insulin receptor nor of IRS1, but it enhanced the tyrosine phosphorylation of the p85 subunit of PI3K. The expression of the SHP-1/PTPN6 phosphatase, which dephosphorylates p85, was reduced after Reptin depletion. Forced expression of SHP-1 restored a normal AKT phosphorylation after insulin treatment in cells where Reptin was silenced, demonstrating that the downregulation of SHP1 is mechanistically linked to increased Akt phosphorylation. In conclusion, we have uncovered a new function for Reptin in regulating insulin signalling in HCC cells via the regulation of SHP-1 expression. We suggest that the regulation of insulin sensitivity by Reptin contributes to its oncogenic action in the liver.</abstracttext>]",[]

The patient underwent partial mastectomy followed by adjuvant radiotherapy and hormone treatment with tamoxifen. Three years later, she presented with a solitary liver lesion on MRI, which was highly suspicious of malignancy. However, several fine needle biopsies were performed, and histopathological examination revealed no signs of neoplasia. As a result of these alarming discrepancies, the multidisciplinary board recommended a diag-nostic laparotomy, which yielded a finding consistent with reactive lymphoid hyperplasia, a pseudolymphoma of the liver, on a background of incipient steatohepatitis. This rare condition is characterized by proliferation of non-neoplastic lymphocytes in extranodular sites, and is usually an incidental finding on imaging modalities in clinically asymptomatic patients, predominantly women. Lesions share some radiologic features with primary malignant liver diseases such as hepatocellular carcinoma or cholangiocarcinoma. Although the etiology remains unclear, reactive lymphoid hyperplasia is believed to be associated with some malignancies, including breast cancer, or inflammatory and autoimmune disorders. Reactive lymphoid hyperplasia usually progresses slowly, with some cases of spontaneous regression described in the literature.

Among several types of theasinensins, theasinensin A (TSA), an epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) dimer with an R-biphenyl bond, is the most abundant theasinensin prevalent in oolong tea. Previous studies have reported that TSA exhibits antioxidative, anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer activities in vitro and in vivo. However, little is known about the hepatoprotective effect of TSA. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate the inhibitory effect of TSA on carbon tetrachloride (CCl<sub>4</sub>)-induced hepatic fibrosis in mice. After intraperitoneal injection of CCl<sub>4</sub> for eight weeks, histological lesions in the liver tissue and elevated serum levels of alanine aminotransferase and alkaline phosphatase were found in mice. Conversely, oral administration of TSA relieved CCl<sub>4</sub>-induced liver injury as well as ameliorated liver functions. Our immunohistochemical staining results revealed that collagen deposition was profoundly reduced due to supplementation with TSA. In addition, we also found that hepatic α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) and matrix metallopeptidase 9 (MMP-9) expression was suppressed through the inhibition of transforming growth factor β (TGF-β). Taken together, our current findings suggest that TSA may serve as a potent bioactive constituent from oolong tea that acts against liver fibrosis through the inhibition of hepatic stellate cell (HSC) activation.</abstracttext>]",[]

Most are benign, but rare examples show malignant histologic characteristics and aggressive behavior. We recently encountered a malignant glomus tumor with BRAF V600E mutation. We sought to study a large cohort for this mutation, with particular attention to associated malignant histologic characteristics. Tumors were classified based on WHO criteria as benign, uncertain malignant potential (glomus tumors of uncertain malignant potential-GT-UMP), or malignant. Tumors were screened for BRAF V600E by immunohistochemistry, and positive staining was evaluated further by Sanger sequencing. A total of 102 glomus tumors were included and classified as benign (57, 56%), GT-UMP (15, 15%) and malignant (30, 29%). Tumors occurred in patients aged 8 to 89.9 years (median: 50.2), without sex predilection (55% men). Most occurred in the superficial soft tissue (84%) and upper extremities (55%). Six of 95 tested cases had BRAF V600E mutation (6%), including 0 of 57 benign tumors, 3 of 14 GT-UMP (21%), and 3 of 24 malignant tumors (12%). Follow-up was obtained for 59 cases (median: 75.7 mo, range: 7.8 to 268.5). Three of 11 malignant tumors (27%) had progressive disease: 1 with metastasis to brain and heart, 1 with enlarging residual disease, and 1 with recurrence. Two of 4 GT-UMP (50%) had progressive disease: 1 with metastasis to lung, and 1 with local recurrence (50%). Three of 44 benign tumors (7%) had local recurrence. Two of 5 patients with BRAF V600E had progression, including 1 GT-UMP with local recurrence and 1 malignant tumor with enlarging residual disease. In summary, BRAF V600E mutation was detected in 6% of glomus tumors, all of which were malignant or GT-UMP. This mutation may be associated with a malignant phenotype, although study of additional cases is needed. In patients with progressive disease, BRAF could be a promising therapeutic target.</abstracttext>]",[]

Clinicopathological data of 570 lung cancer patients were retrospectively analysed for changes in renal function parameters. Co-morbidities included hypertension (50%), COPD (33%) and diabetes mellitus (15%). Statistical analysis was performed with Fisher's exact tests and a Cox proportional hazards model. In patients suffering from hypertension, both median serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) were higher (81.9 versus 75.8 μmol/l, p&lt;0.001 and 6.0 versus 5.7 mmol/l, p=0.005, respectively). Such a difference could not be observed in patients with diabetes. In COPD patients, only serum creatinine was higher (81.1 versus 77.3 μmol/l, p=0.004). In the whole cohort, we found that while at the time of lung cancer diagnosis the ratio of patients in the pathological range (PRR) was 8.67% for serum creatinine (median: 75 μmol/l) and 14.16% for BUN (median: 5.4 mmol/l), at the time of bone metastasis the PRR for serum creatinine increased to 16.11% (median: 77.0 μmol/l) and for BUN to 24.07% (median: 6.0 mmol/l), which is a significant increase for both parameters (p&lt;0.001). For the whole cohort, the last laboratory results showed a 26.37% PRR for serum creatinine and 45.66% PRR for BUN (significant increase for both, p&lt;0.001).

Animal models of traumatic brain injury are commonly used to investigate changes in behavior, morphology, in the expression of various proteins around the site of the injury, or the expression of diagnostically important biomarkers. Excitability of a single neuron at, or close to, the site of injury was rarely investigated. Several in vitro models were developed which allow such investigation. In the present work we employed a fibrotic scar model according to Kimura-Kuroda and coauthors to analyze altered excitability of rat hippocampal neurons under the conditions mimicking traumatic brain injury. Hippocampal neurons from newborn rats were cultured either on a fibrotic scar model or in the presence of TGF-β1, a cytokine secreted at a brain injury site that may have both neuroprotective and neurodegenerative function. Fibrotic scar facilitated ability of neonatal hippocampal neurons to fire action potential series by increasing the density of voltage activated sodium and potassium currents. Chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans played substantial role in these effects, as proven by their full reversion after administration of Chondroitinase ABC. In contrast, TGF-β1 did not contribute to them. An application of TGF-β1 itself attenuated generation of action potentials, inhibited sodium current, and potentiated potassium currents. Main alteration of electrophysiological parameters of neonatal hippocampal neurons caused by a fibrotic scar model is enhanced excitability. TGF-β1 may have predominantly neuroprotective role in injured rat hippocampus. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.</abstracttext>]",[]

In the present study, we provide evidence that ascochlorin, an isoprenoid antibiotic, is a non-toxic anti-cancer agent that induces G1 cell cycle arrest and p21<sup>WAF1/CIP1</sup> expression by downregulating of c-Myc protein expression. Ascochlorin promoted the G1 arrest, upregulated p53 and p21<sup>WAF1/CIP1</sup> , and downregulated c-Myc in HCT116 cells. In p53-deficient cells, ascochlorin enhanced the expression of G1 arrest-related genes except p53. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) mediated c-Myc silencing indicated that the transcriptional repression of c-Myc was related to ascochlorin-mediated modulation of p21<sup>WAF1/CIP1</sup> expression. Ascochlorin suppressed the stabilization of the c-Myc protein by inhibiting ERK and P70S6K/4EBP1 phosphorylation, whereas it had no effect on c-Myc degradation mediated by PI3K/Akt/GSK3β. The ERK inhibitor PD98059 and siRNA-mediated ERK silencing induced G1 arrest and p21<sup>WAF1/CIP1</sup> expression by downregulating c-Myc in p53-deficient cells. These results indicated that ascochlorin-induced G1 arrest is associated with the repression of ERK phosphorylation and c-Myc expression.

Tang BL.,2017,28832532,The Potential of Targeting Brain Pathology with Ascl1/Mash1.,Cells,"[<abstracttext>The proneural factor Achaete-scute complex-like 1 (Ascl1/Mash1) acts as a pioneering transcription factor that initializes neuronal reprogramming. It drives neural progenitors and non-neuronal cells to exit the cell cycle, and promotes neuronal differentiation by activating neuronal target genes, even those that are normally repressed. Importantly, force-expression of Ascl1 was shown to drive proliferative reactive astroglia formed during stroke and glioblastoma stem cells towards neuronal differentiation, and this could potentially diminish CNS damage resulting from their proliferation. As a pro-neural factor, Ascl1 also has the general effect of enhancing neurite growth by damaged or surviving neurons. Here, a hypothesis that brain pathologies associated with traumatic/ischemic injury and malignancy could be targeted with pro-neural factors that drives neuronal differentiation is formulated and explored. Although a good number of caveats exist, exogenous over-expression of Ascl1, alone or in combination with other factors, may be worth further consideration as a therapeutic approach in brain injury and cancer.</abstracttext>]",[]

Survival of patients with glioblastoma remains poor, with only 1 in 4 patients alive at 2 years, and a 5-year survival rate of about 5%. Recurrence is nearly universal and, after recurrence, prognosis is poor with very short progression-free survival and overall survival (OS). Various salvage chemotherapy strategies have been applied with limited success. Tumor Treating Fields (TTFields) are a novel treatment modality approved for treatment of either newly diagnosed or recurrent GBM. TTFields therapy involves a medical device and transducer arrays to provide targeted delivery of low intensity, intermediate frequency, alternating electric fields to produce antimitotic effects selective for rapidly dividing tumor cells with limited toxicity. In the phase 3 EF-14 trial, TTFields plus temozolomide provided significantly longer progression-free survival and OS compared with temozolomide alone in patients with newly diagnosed GBM after initial chemoradiotherapy. The addition of TTFields to standard therapy improved median OS from 15.6 to 20.5 months (P=0.04). In the phase 3 EF-11 trial, for recurrent GBM, TTFields provided comparable efficacy as investigator's choice systemic therapy, with improved patient-reported quality of life and a lower incidence of serious adverse events. Primary toxicity associated with TTFields is skin irritation generally managed with array relocation and topical treatments including antibiotics and steroids.

When deciding about WBRT, WHO score, level of care before WBRT, and the patient's choice of level of care in the end-of-life period should be considered.</abstracttext>]",[]

Recently, it was elucidated that two-thirds of supratentorial (ST) ependymomas harbor oncogenic fusions of RELA, whose protein product is the principal effector of canonical NF-κB signaling. RELA fusion proteins activate signaling for tumor proliferation and malignant progression, resulting in poorer prognoses in these patients compared to those in patients with other ST ependymomas. In this study, we encountered a case of C11orf-RelA fusion-positive ST anaplastic ependymoma that was diagnosed in first tumor resection surgery of multi-staged gross total resection with molecular evidence. In ependymomas, regardless of tumor location or pathological grade, subtotal resection is associated with higher rates of mortality compared with GTR. Molecular analysis based on the application of recent molecular knowledge for ST ependymomas performs a role in appropriate and individualized treatment strategies.</abstracttext>]",[]

Here, we document that EGFR and PDGFRA protein co-expression occurs in 37% of GBM. There is wide cell-to-cell variation in the expressions of these receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) in stable tumor sphere lines, frequently defining tumor cell subpopulations with distinct sensitivities to growth factors and RTK inhibitors. We also find evidence for functional transactivation of PDGFRA by EGFR and EGF-induced receptor heterodimerization, both of which are abolished by EGFR inhibitors. These results indicate that GBM growth responses to targeted therapies previously tested in clinical trials are strongly influenced by the balance of EGFR and PDGFRA activation in individual cells, which is heterogeneous at baseline.</abstracttext>]",[]

Here we investigated if gestational hypoxia promotes damaging secretions from the placenta that affect fetal development and whether a mitochondria-targeted antioxidant MitoQ might prevent this. Gestational hypoxia caused low birth-weight and changes in young adult offspring brain, mimicking those in human neuropsychiatric disease. Exposure of cultured neurons to fetal plasma or to secretions from the placenta or from model trophoblast barriers that had been exposed to altered oxygenation caused similar morphological changes. The secretions and plasma contained altered microRNAs whose targets were linked with changes in gene expression in the fetal brain and with human schizophrenia loci. Molecular and morphological changes in vivo and in vitro were prevented by a single dose of MitoQ bound to nanoparticles, which were shown to localise and prevent oxidative stress in the placenta but not in the fetus. We suggest the possibility of developing preventative treatments that target the placenta and not the fetus to reduce risk of psychiatric disease in later life.</abstracttext>]",[]

The management of pediatric HGG continues to be challenging, with poor outcome in many cases despite aggressive treatments. Consequently, parallel research efforts have been focused on identifying the underlying genetic and biological basis of pediatric HGG in order to more clearly define prognostic subgroups for treatment stratification as well as identify new treatment targets. These cutting-edge advances have revolutionized pediatric neuro-oncology and have revealed novel oncogenic vulnerabilities that are being therapeutically leveraged. Promising treatments - including pathway-targeting small molecules as well as epigenetic therapy - are being evaluated in clinical trials, and recent genomic discoveries in rare glioma subgroups have led to the identification of additional new potentially-actionable alterations. This review summarizes the current state of knowledge about the molecular characterization of pediatric HGG in correlation to the revised World Health Organization (WHO) classification, as well as provides an overview of some targeted treatment approaches in the modern clinical management of high-grade gliomas.</abstracttext>]",[]
