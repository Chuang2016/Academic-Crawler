In October 2014, computed tomography (CT) revealed a mass of approximately 1cm in the lateral portion of the right breast. Breast ultrasonography (US) revealed a well-circumscribed, hypoechoic mass at the same site. Fine needle aspiration (FNA) was performed, but the sample was inadequate because it did not capture breast duct epithelial cells. In June 2015, follow-up US revealed enlargement of the mass, and core needle biopsy (CNB) was performed to confirm the diagnosis. Histological examination resulted in the diagnosis of breast metastasis from an RCC. The patient underwent surgery for partial mastectomy in November 2015.

IMP1 is frequently overexpressed in cancer and is strongly correlated with a poor prognosis and reduced survival in melanoma, ovarian, breast, colon, and lung cancer. While IMP1 is an attractive anticancer drug target, there are no small molecule inhibitors of IMP1. A fluorescence anisotropy-based assay was used to screen 160,000 small molecules for their ability to inhibit IMP1 binding to fluorescein-labeled c-Myc mRNA. The small molecule, BTYNB, was identified as a potent and selective inhibitor of IMP1 binding to c-Myc mRNA. In cells, BTYNB downregulates several mRNA transcripts regulated by IMP1. BTYNB destabilizes c-Myc mRNA, resulting in downregulation of c-Myc mRNA and protein. BTYNB downregulates β-TrCP1 mRNA and reduces activation of nuclear transcriptional factors-kappa B (NF-κB). The oncogenic translation regulator, eEF2, emerged as a new IMP1 target mRNA, enabling BTYNB to inhibit tumor cell protein synthesis. BTYNB potently inhibited proliferation of IMP1-containing ovarian cancer and melanoma cells with no effect in IMP1-negative cells. Overexpression of IMP1 reversed BTYNB inhibition of cell proliferation. BTYNB completely blocked anchorage-independent growth of melanoma and ovarian cancer cells in colony formation assays. With its ability to target c-Myc and to inhibit proliferation of difficult-to-target melanomas and ovarian cancer cells, and with its unique mode of action, BTYNB is a promising small molecule for further therapeutic evaluation and mechanistic studies.</abstracttext>]",[]

In an apparent paradox, we observed low expression of HOTAIR in the invasive Claudin-low MDA-MB-231 and Hs578T cells in two-dimensional culture (2D). However, HOTAIR expression exhibited robust induction in laminin-rich extracellular matrix based three-dimensional organotypic culture (lrECM 3D) over that in 2D culture. Induction of HOTAIR required intact ECM signaling, namely integrin α2 and SRC kinase activity. Moreover, invasive growth was abrogated by HOTAIR-specific siRNAs. Induction of HOTAIR in lrECM 3D culture resulted from activation of a novel isoform of HOTAIR (HOTAIR-N) whose transcription is started from the 1<sup>st</sup> intron of the HOXC11 gene. The HOTAIR-N promoter exhibited increased trimethylation of histone H3 lysine 4, a histone marker of active transcription, and binding of BRD4, a reader of transcriptionally active histone markers. Inhibition of BRD4 substantially reduced the expression of HOTAIR in lrECM 3D culture. In summary, our results indicate that HOTAIR expression is activated by BRD4 binding to a novel HOTAIR-N promoter in Claudin-low breast cancer cells that are attached to ECM.

However, the underlying molecular mechanisms are poorly defined. To better understand the molecular mechanisms underlying TCTP involved in cellular processes, we performed an affinity purification-based proteomic profiling to identify proteins interacting with TCTP in human cervical cancer HeLa cells. We found that a group of proteins involved in DNA repair are enriched in the potential TCTP interactome. Silencing TCTP by short hairpin RNA in breast carcinoma MCF-7 cells leads to the declined repair efficiency for DNA double-strand breaks on the GFP-Pem1 reporter gene by homologous recombination, the persistent activation and the prolonged retention of γH2AX and Rad51 foci following ionizing radiation. Reciprocal immunoprecipitations indicated that TCTP forms complexes with Rad51 in vivo, and the stability maintenance of Rad51 requires TCTP in MCF-7 cells under normal cell culture conditions. Moreover, inactivation of TCTP by sertraline treatment enhances UVC irradiation-induced apoptosis in MCF-7 cells, and causes sensitization to DNA-damaging drug etoposide and DNA repair inhibitor olaparib. Thus, we have identified an important role of TCTP in promoting DNA double-stand break repair via facilitating DNA homologous recombination processes and highlighted the great potential of TCTP as a drug target to enhance conventional chemotherapy for cancer patients with high levels of TCTP expression.Oncogene advance online publication, 28 August 2017; doi:10.1038/onc.2017.289.</abstracttext>]",[]

Accumulating evidence indicates that Vps34 may also contribute to the development and progression of human cancers. However, the mechanism of Vps34 in tumorigenesis remains elusive. Here, we report an unanticipated role of Vps34 in the activation of p62 for cancer development. We identified that Vps34 is a transcriptional activator of p62 through competition of Nrf2 (nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2) for Keap1 binding. Vps34 augments the association of PKC-δ with p62 for its phosphorylation at Serine 349, which leads to positive feedback on the Nrf2-dependent transcription of oncogenes. Additionally, we found that the expression of Vps34 is correlated with the tumorigenic activity of human breast cancer cells. Normally inactive in breast cancer, caspase 8 can cleave Vps34 at residue D285, which directly abolished its lipid kinase activity and dramatically altered cell invasion potential, colony formation, as well as tumorigenesis in orthotopic engraftments in mice. The cleavage at D285 blocks expression of LC3-II, Nrf2 and subsequently, p62, in addition to blocking tumor growth, indicating that the intact structure of Vps34 is essential for its activity. Moreover, either knockout of PKC-δ or knockdown of p62 by small interfering RNA in MCF-7 cells abrogates Vps34-dependent tumor growth. Data presented here suggested that Vps34 stimulates tumor development mainly through PKC-δ- activation of p62.Oncogene advance online publication, 28 August 2017; doi:10.1038/onc.2017.295.</abstracttext>]",[]

In a human mammary epithelial cell system that recapitulates early breast tumorigenesis, the fraction of actively transcribed Pol III genes increases reaching a plateau during immortalization. Hyper-methylation of Pol III genes inhibits Pol III binding to DNA via inducing repressed chromatin and is a determinant for the Pol III repertoire. When Pol III genes are hypo-methylated, MYC amplifies their transcription, regardless of its recognition DNA motif.

Here, we first showed that CRP induces adhesion of MCF10A human breast epithelial cells through the activation of integrin α2 signaling. Expression of integrin α2 was induced by CRP in which transcription factors c-fos and SP1 may be involved. Binding of CRP with integrin α2 leads to the activation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK), paxillin and ERKs. CRP also binds to an Fcγ receptor Fcγ receptor I (FcγRI), and induces activation of paxillin, FAK and ERKs. Integrin α2 and FAK have crucial roles in the adhesive and invasive phenotypes as well as MMP-9 upregulation induced by CRP in MCF10A cells. Treatment with an inflammatory lipid sphingosine-1-phosphate induced CRP, which may be secreted and exert an autocrine effect by binding to FcγRI and integrin α2.

We used multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression to estimate hazards ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for associations with breast cancer overall and by ER status, mutually adjusted for the three factors of interest. Adult height was associated with increased risk of ER+ breast cancer (HR for ≥70 inches vs. ≤63 inches: 1.44; 95% CI: 1.09, 1.89) but not ER- (corresponding HR: 1.16; 95% CI: 0.78, 1.71) (P-heterogeneity=0.34). HRs for attained height before age 13 vs. age &gt;17 were 1.30 (95% CI: 0.96, 1.76) for ER+ and 1.25 (95% CI: 0.80, 1.96) for ER- breast cancer. Results for age at menarche (≤11 years vs. ≥14 years) were similar for ER+ and ER- breast cancer (HR for breast cancer overall: 1.30; 95%CI: 1.12, 1.50). We confirmed height as a strong risk factor for ER+ breast cancer in African American women and identified early age at attained height as a risk factor for both ER+ and ER- breast cancer, albeit without statistical significance of the latter associations. While adult height and timing of pubertal growth are inter-related, our findings suggest that they may be independent risk factors for breast cancer. This article is protected by copyright.

Although papillomas without frank cancer are benign, their management remains controversial. When a core needle biopsy of a lesion yields a diagnosis of intraductal papilloma with atypia, excision is generally recommended to rule out a concurrent malignant neoplasm. For intraductal papillomas without atypia, however, recommendations for excision versus observation are variable. The aims of this study are to evaluate the rate of concurrent malignancies for intraductal papilloma diagnosed on core needle biopsy and to assess the long-term risk of developing cancer after the diagnosis of a papillary lesion. This single institution retrospective study analyzed 259 patients that were diagnosed with intraductal papilloma (IDP) by core needle biopsy from 1995 to 2010. Patients were grouped by initial diagnosis into three groups (papilloma without atypia, papilloma with atypia, and papilloma with atypical duct hyperplasia or atypical lobular hyperplasia (ADH/ALH) and followed up for long-term outcomes. After a core needle biopsy showing IDP with atypia or IDP + ADH/ALH, surgical excision yielded a diagnosis of concomitant invasive or ductal in situ cancer in greater that 30% of cases. For intraductal papilloma without atypia, the likelihood of cancer was much lower. Moreover, even with excision, the finding of intraductal papilloma with atypia carries a significant risk of developing cancer long-term, and such patients should be followed carefully and perhaps should be considered for chemoprevention.</abstracttext>]",[]

Cancer-related fatigue, insomnia, and cancer-related cognitive impairment are likely to have multiple etiologies that make it difficult to identify the most effective method to manage them. In this review, we summarized the information on cancer-related fatigue, insomnia, and cancer-related cognitive impairment incidence and prevalence among breast cancer patients and survivors as well as recent research findings on pharmaceutical, psychological, and exercise interventions that have shown effectiveness in the treatment of these side effects. Our review revealed that most current pharmaceutical interventions tend to ameliorate symptoms only temporarily without addressing the underlying causes.

They occur rarely but confer a high probability of local recurrence (LR) and poor prognosis. A wide range of treatment strategies exists due to limited evidence, and although resection is the definitive treatment, LR rates remain high. It has been suggested hyperfractionated accelerated radiotherapy (HART) has the potential to prevent LR. The sarcoma group at the Juravinski Cancer Centre (JCC) reports our experience of nine patients treated with radical resection and adjuvant HART. This is one of the largest reported cohorts we are aware of to receive this treatment. The JCC pathologic data base was reviewed between the year 2006-2015 for patients with RAS. Patients who received radical surgery and immediate HART were eligible. Patients underwent radical chest wall resection and en bloc mastectomy. Radiotherapy was then delivered to 4500 cGy in 45 fractions three times daily using parallel opposed photon beams and electron patching, or volumetric modulated arc therapy. Primary outcome was recurrence-free survival in months, and records were reviewed for descriptive reports of toxicity. We compared our results to other institutions experience with surgery alone or other adjuvant therapies. Median follow-up was 19 months (range 3-41 months). One of nine patients developed LR and developed metastasis, one died of other causes, and seven are alive with no recurrent disease. There were seven reports of mild skin toxicity during treatment. One patient developed chronic wound healing complications which eventually resolved and one patient developed asymptomatic radiation osteitis of a rib. On the basis of our experience at the JCC, we recommend treatment with radical chest wall resection and adjuvant HART to prevent recurrence in RAS patients. As demonstrated in our patients, the large normal tissue volume irradiated is tolerable with in combination with small fraction sizes, and no major toxicities were seen. Further investigation into adjuvant therapy regimens and prospective studies are required to reach consensus on optimal treatment for this disease.</abstracttext>]",[]

MCF-7 breast cancer cells were cultured and treated with visfatin. SIRT1 activity was assessed by measuring fluorescence intensity from fluoro-substrate peptide. To investigate the effect of visfatin on p53 acetylation, SDS-PAGE followed by western blotting was performed using specific antibodies against p53 and its acetylated form. Total NAD was measured both in cell lysate and the extracellular medium by colorimetric method. Visfatin increased both extracellular and intracellular NAD concentrations. It also induced proliferation of breast cancer cells, an effect that was abolished by inhibition of its enzymatic activity. Visfatin significantly increased SIRT1 activity, accompanied by induction of p53 deacetylation. In conclusion, the results show that extracellular visfatin produces NAD that causes upregulation of SIRT1 activity and p53 deacetylation.

In general, conventional cancer treatment options (i.e., surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, biological therapy, and hormone therapy) are not completely effective. Recurrence and other pathologic situations are still an issue in breast cancer patients due to side effects, toxicity of drugs in normal cells, and aggressive behaviour of the tumours. From this point of view, breast cancer therapy and adjuvant methods represent a promising and challenging field for researchers. In the last few years, the use of some types of complementary medicines by women with a history of breast cancer has significantly increased such as phytotherapeutic products and nutritional supplements. Despite this, the use of such approaches in oncologic processes may be problematic and patient's health risks can arise such as interference with the efficacy of standard cancer treatment. The present review gives an overview of the most usual phytotherapeutic products and nutritional supplements with application in breast cancer patients as adjuvant approach.

Previous studies have shown that microRNA-221/222 (miR-221/222) cluster are involved in the propagation of breast cancer stem cell (BCSC), however, the underlying molecular mechanisms are still not fully understood. In this study, we found that miR-221/222 were overexpressed in highly aggressive breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells, that are enriched in markers for epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and BCSCs, than in MCF-7 cells. Phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) was confirmed to be the target of miR-221/222 in breast cancer cells. MiR-221/222 enhanced breast cancer cell growth, migration and invasion by downregulating PTEN. Importantly, both ectopic expression of miR-221/222 and PTEN knockdown increased the mammosphere formation capacity and the expression of the stemness marker ALDH1. MiR-221/222 lentivirus vector infected MCF-7 cells produced larger subcutaneous tumors, while shRNA vector of PTEN showed similar trend. Along with the downregulation of PTEN caused by miR-221/222 in the breast cancer cells and the xenograft tumor tissues, Akt phosphorylation (p-Akt), NF-κB p65 and phosphorylated p65 (p-p65), and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) were all overexpressed compared to the negative control. Taken together, our findings indicate that miR-221/222 play a critical role in the propagation of BCSCs and tumor growth possibly through targeting PTEN, which in turn activating the Akt/NF-κB/COX-2 pathway.

We recently found that the TBC1D3 oncogene promotes the migration of breast cancer cells, and its interaction with CaM enhances the effects of TBC1D3. However, little is known regarding the mechanism by which TBC1D3 induces the migration of cancer cells. Here, we demonstrated that TBC1D3 stimulated the expression of oxidized low density lipoprotein receptor 1 (OLR1), a stimulator of cell migration, in breast cancer cells at the transcriptional level. Depletion of OLR1 by siRNAs or down-regulation of OLR1 expression using pomalidomide, a TNFα inhibitor, significantly decreased TBC1D3-induced migration of these cells. Notably, TBC1D3 overexpression activated NF-κB, a major effector of TNFα signaling, while inhibition of TNFα signaling suppressed the effects of TBC1D3. Consistent with this, NF-κB inhibition using its specific inhibitor caffeic acid phenethyl ester decreased both TBC1D3-induced OLR1 expression and cell migration, suggesting a critical role for TNFα/NF-κB signaling in TBC1D3-induced migration of breast cancer cells. Mechanistically, TBC1D3 induced activation of this signaling pathway on multiple levels, including by increasing the release of TNFα, elevating the transcription of TNFR1, TRAF1, TRAF5 and TRAF6, and decreasing the degradation of TNFR1. In summary, these studies identify the TBC1D3 oncogene as a novel regulator of TNFα/NF-κB signaling that mediates this oncogene-induced migration of human breast cancer cells by up-regulating OLR1.</abstracttext>]",[]

This current study aims to determine the molecular mechanism underlying SL-1-18's effect on breast cancer cell growth. Our results indicate that SL-1-18 inhibits cell proliferation of ER+ breast cancer cells (MCF-7 and T-47D) by preventing cell cycle progression. SL-1-18 treatment correlated positively with decreased expression of key cell-cycle regulators, such as cyclin D1, as well as other ERα-target genes at both the transcript and protein levels. Interestingly, decreased expression of ERα was also observed, with a significant reduction at the protein level within 2 hours of SL-1-18 treatment, while the decrease in mRNA occurred at a later time point. ERα degradation was shown to be mediated by the ubiquitination-proteasome pathway. In summary, this is the first study to show that a Flex-Het- SL-1-18- can promote the degradation of ERα via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway and should be further developed as a therapeutic option for ER+ breast cancer.</abstracttext>]",[]

progression and treatment effectiveness. An increase in CTCs is associated with cancer progression, a CTC decrease
with cancer containment or remission. Several technologies have been developed to identify CTC, including the
validated Isolation-by-Size-of-Epithelial-Tumour (ISET, Rarecells) technology, combining blood filtration and
microscopy using standard histo-pathological criteria. Methods: This observational study compared CTC count to
cancer status and cancer risk, by monitoring treatment effectiveness in cancer patients and by screening for CTC in
asymptomatic patients with risk factors, including family history of cancer. Results: Between Sept-2014 and Dec-2016
we undertook 600 CTC tests (542 patients), including 50% screening requests of patients without cancer diagnosis but
with risk factors. CTC were detected in all cancer patients (n=277, 100%), and in half of the asymptomatic patients
screened (50%, 132 out-of 265 patients). Follow-up tests including scans, scheduled within 1-10 months of positive
CTC tests, found early cancerous lesions in 20% of screened patients. In 50% of male patients with CTC and normal
PSA (prostate-specific-antigen) levels, PSMA-PET scans revealed increased uptake in the prostate, indicative of early
prostate cancer. Other types of cancers detected by CTC screening and subsequent scans included early breast, ovarian,
lung, or renal cancer. Patients with CTC were advised on integrative approaches including immune-stimulating and
anti-carcinogenic nutritional therapies. CTC repeat tests were available in 10% of patients with detected CTC (40 outof
409 patients, n=98 CTC tests) to assess treatment effectiveness, suggesting nutritional therapies to be beneficial in
reducing CTC count. Conclusions: CTC screening provided a highly sensitive biomarker for the early detection of
cancer, with higher CTC counts being associated with higher risk of malignancy. CTC monitoring over time indicated
treatment effectiveness. Nutrients with anti-carcinogenic properties could reduce CTC count, and included curcumin,

Reproductive, family, personal, and occupational history data were collected. The latest occupation of each woman was collected and coded according to the 1994 National Classification of Occupations. Mammographic density was assessed from the cranio-caudal mammogram of the left breast using a semi-automated computer-assisted tool. Association between mammographic density and occupation was evaluated by using mixed linear regression models, using log-transformed percentage of mammographic density as dependent variable. Models were adjusted for age, body mass index, menopausal status, parity, smoking, alcohol intake, educational level, type of mammography, first-degree relative with breast cancer, and hormonal replacement therapy use.

During metastasis, cancer cells create new conditions in which normal tissue structure can be disturbed. Nephronectin, which is the primary ligand for α8β1 integrin, plays an important role in kidney development. There are conflicting findings regarding its role in cancer progression and metastasis, especially in breast carcinoma. The aim of this study was to determine changes in nephronectin expression in primary tumor tissues and metastatic visceral organs, using metastatic and non-metastatic cell lines in a mouse model of breast cancer. In our study, 4T1-Liver Metastatic and 4T1-Heart Metastatic cells, originally derived from 4T1-murine breast carcinoma, and non-metastatic 67NR carcinoma cells were used. Cancer cells were injected orthotopically into the mammary gland of 8-10 week-old Balb-c mice. Primary tumors, lung, liver tissues were collected on 12th and 25th days after the tumor injection. Immunohistochemistry was used to determine expression of nephronectin in tissues. We also investigated the expression levels of the protein by using western blot technique. We found that lung and liver tissue of control animals (not-injected with tumor cells) expressed nephronectin which was lost in animals bearing metastatic tumor for 25 days. In accordance, nephronectin staining of lung and liver was preserved in animals injected with non-metastatic 67NR tumors. These results demonstrate that loss of nephronectin may play an important role in formation metastatic milieu for cancer cells.

Recently, we have solved the crystal structure of the phosphatase domain of PTPN12, which disclosed a specific PTPN12-insert-loop harboring a cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)-2 phosphorylation site. However, the functional significance of this phosphorylation is undefined. In the present study, we found that S19 site phosphorylation of PTPN12 by CDK2 discharged its antitumor activity by down-regulation of its inhibitory role in cell migration, but not affecting its other regulatory functions. Phosphorylation of PTPN12 at the S19 site changed its substrate interface, and by doing so, selectively decreased its activity toward the human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER)-2 pY<sup>1196</sup> site, but not other HER2 phosphorylation sites or other known PTPN12 substrates. A further in-depth mechanism study revealed that the phosphorylation of PTPN12 by CDK2 impaired recruitment of the serine/threonine-protein kinase (PAK)-1 to HER2, resulted in the blockade of the HER2-pY<sup>1196</sup>-PAK1-T<sup>423</sup> signaling pathway, thus increased tumor cell motility. Taken together, our results identified a new phosphorylation-based substrate recognition mechanism of PTPN12 by CDK2, which orchestrated signaling crosstalk between the oncogenic CDK2 and HER2 pathways.

Here we report that the expression of the basic helix-loop-helix myogenic regulatory factor MYOD was abnormally up-regulated in letrozole-resistant BCa tissues and in experimentally-induced letrozole-resistant BCa cells. Overexpression of the exogenous MYOD impaired ERα expression and potentiated letrozole-resistance in letrozole-sensitive MCF7 cells, whereas MYOD knockdown could effectively restore ERα expression and thereby promote letrozole-sensitivity in letrozole-resistant MCF-7/LR cells. Mechanistically, MYOD was shown to be a potent corepressor of ESR1 transcription, and this transcriptional repression was significantly enhanced in the presence of letrozole treatment. Thus, targeted inhibition of MYOD may restore ERα level and lead to resensitization to letrozole-based hormone therapy, providing a novel therapeutic strategy for relapsed ERα-positive BCa patients.

Recently we reported the synthesis of new inhibitors based on a quinazoline scaffold. In the present study more structural variations were explored. Compounds with 3,4-dimethoxy groups and meta or para nitro substituents were found to be highly potent inhibitors of ABCG2. The most potent compound was more than five-fold more potent than Ko143, one of the best inhibitors of ABCG2. To determine the new compounds selectivity toward ABCG2 their inhibitory effects on ABCB1 and ABCC1 were also investigated identifying selective as well as broadspectrum inhibitors. Furthermore, intrinsic cytotoxicity and efficacy regarding the reversal of multidrug resistance toward SN-38 and mitoxantrone were explored. The most potent compounds were able to reverse the resistance toward the cytostatic agents with EC<sub>50</sub> values below 20 nM. Additionally, the type of interaction between inhibitors and the ABCG2 substrate Hoechst 33342 was investigated yielding competitive and non-competitive interactions suggesting different modes of binding. Finally the effect of the derivatives on vanadate-sensitive ATPase activity of ABCG2 was determined. According to the different effects on ATPase activity we conclude the existence of different binding sites.

A crucial enzyme catalyzing collagen formation, prolyl 4-hydroxylase subunit α2 (P4HA2) was evaluated by immunohistochemistry, western blotting or quantitative reverse transcription-PCR analysis. The function of HBV-modulated P4HA2 in hepatoma cell growth in vitro and in vivo was analyzed by EdU, MTT, colony-forming assay and animal transplantation assay. HBV transgenic mice exhibited more collagen deposition in liver after intraperitoneal injection of CCl<sub>4</sub>. P4HA2 was dramatically augmented in liver samples of HBV transgenic mice, clinical liver cirrhosis and liver cancer patients. Mechanistically, HBx was capable of inducing P4HA2 through suppressing miR-30e, in which miR-30e could target P4HA2 mRNA 3' untranslated region in liver cancer cells. HBx inhibited the miR-30e expression through increasing methylation of CpG islands in its promoter mediated by EZH2-formed complexes. Functionally, HBx-elevated P4HA2 enhanced the collagen deposition in the liver in vivo and in vitro, leading to liver fibrosis and liver cancer progression.

Here, we have developed a model of JMML using mice that express KrasG12D in multipotent progenitor cells (Flt3Cre+ KrasG12D mice). These mice express KrasG12D in utero, are born at normal Mendelian ratios, develop hepatosplenomegaly, anemia, and thrombocytopenia, and succumb to a rapidly progressing and fully penetrant neonatal myeloid disease. Mutant mice have altered hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell populations in the BM and spleen that are hypersensitive to granulocyte macrophage-CSF due to hyperactive RAS/ERK signaling. Biased differentiation in these progenitors results in an expansion of neutrophils and DCs and a concomitant decrease in T lymphocytes. Flt3Cre+ KrasG12D fetal liver hematopoietic progenitors give rise to a myeloid disease upon transplantation.

This shortcoming could be overcome by modifying pharmacokinetics of the drugs via preparation of various nanoplatforms. Doxil, a well-known FDA-approved nanoplatform of doxorubicin as antineoplastic agent, is frequently used in clinics in order to reduce cardiotoxicity of doxorubicin. Since Doxil shows some shortcomings in clinics including hand and food syndrome and very slow release pattern thus, there is a demand for the development and preparation of new doxorubicin nanoformulation with fewer side effects. The new formulation of the doxorubicin, synthesized previously by our group was extensively examined in the current study. This new formulation is doxorubicin encapsulated in PEG-PLGA polymersomes (PolyDOX). The main aim of the study was to compare the distribution and treatment efficacy of a new doxorubicin-polymersomal formulation (PolyDOX) with regular liposomal formulation (Doxil-mimic) in murine colon adenocarcinoma model. Additionally, the pathological, hematological changes, pharmacodynamics, biodistribution, tolerated dose and survival rate in vivo were evaluated and compared. Murine colon cancer model was induced by subcutaneous inoculation of BALB/c mice with C26 cells. Afterwards, either Doxil-mimic or PolyDOX was administered intravenously. The obtained results from biodistribution study showed a remarkable difference in the distribution of drugs in murine organs. In this regard, Doxil-mimic exhibited prolonged (48h) presence within liver tissues while PolyDOX preferentially accumulate in tumor and the presence in liver 48h post-treatment was significantly lower than that of Doxil-mimic. Obtained results demonstrated comparable final length of life for mice receiving either Doxil-mimic or PolyDOX formulations whereas tolerated dose of mice receiving Doxil-mimic was remarkably higher than those receiving PolyDOX. Therapeutic efficacy of formulation in term of tumor growth rate after one injection of formulations (5mg/kg, 10mg/kg or 15mg/kg) demonstrated better efficacy at lower dose for PolyDOX. Analysis of Kaplan Meier curve was in favor of both formulations in their treatment-dose. Pathological and hematological surveys of mice treated with both formulations did not show considerable difference except for a small atrophy in liver observed after successive administration of Doxil-mimic. It could be concluded that PolyDOX can potentially limit off-site effects of Doxil due to its biodegradability and sustained release properties while it exhibited favorable safety profile comparable to Doxil.</abstracttext>]",[]

Epidemiological investigations and preclinical studies suggest that statins such as atorvastatin have antitumor activity for various types of cancer. Tuberous sclerosis (TSC) is a tumor syndrome caused by TSC1 or TSC2 mutations that lead to aberrant activation of mTOR and tumor formation in multiple organs. Previous studies have demonstrated that atorvastatin selectively suppressed growth and proliferation of mouse Tsc2 null embryonic fibroblasts through inhibition of mTOR. However, atorvastatin alone did not reduce tumor burden in the liver and kidneys of Tsc2<sup>+/-</sup> mice as assessed by histological analysis, and no combination therapy of rapamycin and atorvastatin has been tried. In this study, we used T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging to track changes in tumor number and size in the kidneys of a Tsc1<sup>+/-</sup> mouse model and to assess the efficacy of rapamycin and atorvastatin alone and as a combination therapy. We found that rapamycin alone or rapamycin combined with atorvastatin significantly reduced tumor burden, while atorvastatin alone did not. Combined therapy with rapamycin and atorvastatin appeared to be more effective for treating renal tumors than rapamycin alone, but the difference was not statistically significant. We conclude that combined therapy with rapamycin and atorvastatin is unlikely to provide additional benefit over rapamycin as a single agent in the treatment of Tsc-associated renal tumors.</abstracttext>]",[]

These flavones can induce apoptosis in a variety of cancer cell lines but have no effect on normal cells. Furthermore, they have many additional benefits for human health, such as anti-oxidant, antiviral, and liver-protective properties. We describe isolation and characterization of two CYP450 enzymes (SbCYP82D1.1 and SbCYP82D2) that function as the flavone 6-hydroxylase (F6H) and flavone 8-hydroxylase (F8H), respectively, in S. baicalensis. SbCYP82D1.1 has a broad specificity for flavones like chrysin and apigenin and is responsible for biosynthesis of baicalein and scutellarein in roots and aerial parts of S. baicalensis, respectively. When expression of SbCYP82D1.1 is knocked-down, baicalin and baicalein levels are reduced significantly while chrysin glycosides accumulate in hairy roots. CYP82D2 is an F8H with high substrate specificity, accepting only chrysin as its substrate to produce norwogonin, while minor 6-hydroxylation activity can also be detected. Phylogenetic analysis suggested that CYP82D2 might have evolved from SbCYP82D1.1 via gene duplication followed neofunctionalization, where the ancestral F6H activity is partially retained in the derived CYP82D2.</abstracttext>]",[]

Anticipating surgical risk is critical in accurately evaluating the risk/benefit balance of such treatment. Determining the risk and cost-effectiveness of surgery, complications, revision procedures, and mortality rates are the most significant limitations. The purpose of this study was to determine independent risk factors for medical complications (MCs), surgical complications (SCs), revisions, and mortality rates following surgery for patients with cervical spine pathology. The most relevant risk factors were used to structure an index that will help quantify risk and anticipate failure for such procedures. METHODS The authors of this study performed a retrospective review of the National Inpatient Sample (NIS) database for patients treated surgically for cervical spine pathology between 2001 and 2010. Multivariate models were performed to calculate the odds ratio (OR) of the independent risk factors that led to MCs and repeated for SCs, revisions, and mortality. The models controlled for age (&lt; and &gt; 65 years old), sex, race, revision status (except for revision analysis), surgical approach, number of levels fused/re-fused (2-3, 4-8, ≥ 9), and osteotomy utilization. ORs were weighted based on their predictive category: 2 times for revision surgery predictors and 4 times for mortality predictors. Fifty points were distributed among the predictors based on their cumulative OR to establish a risk index. RESULTS Discharges for 362,989 patients with cervical spine pathology were identified. The mean age was 52.65 years, and 49.47% of patients were women. Independent risk factors included medical comorbidities, surgical parameters, and demographic factors. Medical comorbidities included the following: pulmonary circulation disorder, coagulopathy, metastatic cancer, renal failure, congestive heart failure, alcohol abuse, neurological disorder, nonmetastatic cancer, liver disease, rheumatoid arthritis/collagen vascular diseases, and chronic blood loss/anemia. Surgical parameters included posterior approach to fusion/re-fusion, ≥ 9 levels fused/re-fused, corpectomy, 4-8 levels fused/re-fused, and osteotomy; demographic variables included age ≥ 65 years. These factors increased the risk of at least 1 of MC, SC, revision, or mortality (risk of death). A total of 50 points were distributed among the factors based on the cumulative risk ratio of every factor in proportion to the total risk ratios. CONCLUSIONS This study proposed an index to quantify the potential risk of morbidity and mortality prior to surgical intervention for patients with cervical spine pathology. This index may be useful for surgeons in patient counseling efforts as well as for health insurance companies and future socioeconomics studies in assessing surgical risks and benefits for patients undergoing surgical treatment of the cervical spine.</abstracttext>]",[]

Mortality from all causes, and cancer, cardiovascular (CVD) and other causes was analysed using Poisson regression model with the following variables: sex, age, DM, statin and metformin usage in baseline, cancer type and stage, and calendar period. Statin usage was associated with a reduced cancer-specific mortality with incidence rate ratio (IRR) 0.72 (95% confidence interval 0.69-0.74), IRR for CVD mortality was 0.95 (0.88-1.02), and for other causes 0.64 (0.56-0.74). In a sub-population of DM patients, IRR for metformin in all-cause mortality was 0.74 (0.71-0.78), in cancer mortality 0.75 (0.72-0.79), in CVD mortality 0.75 (0.68-0.83), and other causes 0.68 (0.60-0.78). In conclusion, our register-based study of survival after cancer diagnosis showed that patients with diabetes had substantially poorer outcome in all measures. An association between baseline statin usage and lower all-cause, cancer, and cardiovascular mortality was modified by cancer type. The effect of statin use was largest for breast and colorectal cancer. Metformin usage in a subpopulation of oral antidiabetic users was in general associated with lower mortality, but this association was modified by cancer type.

However, by the early 1990s it was well recognized by the medical research community. Over the last two decades, the picture has been totally changed. Diverse lines of evidence have converged to show that this sometime poison is a fundamental player in the everyday business of the human body. NO activity was probed in the brain, arteries, immune system, liver, pancreas, uterus, peripheral nerves, lungs, and almost every system in the human body. NO is a major player in the cardiovascular system as it is involved in regulating blood pressure. In the CNS, it is involved in memory formation and the regulation of cerebral blood flow to ensure adequate supply of blood to the brain. Because NO is involved in many pathways, it has a role in several diseases related to modern life as hypertension, coronary heart diseases, Alzheimer's Disease, stroke and cancer.

These cancers are very aggressive and rapidly metastasize, thus identifying effective targets is crucial for treatment. Galectin-1 (Gal-1) belongs to a family of glycan-binding proteins, or lectins, with the ability to cross-link specific glycoconjugates. A variety of biological activities have been attributed to Gal-1 at different steps of tumor progression. Herein, we summarize the current literature regarding the roles of Gal-1 in gastrointestinal malignancies. Accumulating evidence shows that Gal-1 is drastically up-regulated in human gastric cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, colorectal cancer and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma tissues, both in tumor epithelial and tumor-associated stromal cells. Moreover, Gal-1 makes a crucial contribution to the pathogenesis of gastrointestinal malignancies, favoring tumor development, aggressiveness, metastasis, immunosuppression and angiogenesis. We also highlight that alterations in Gal-1-specific glycoepitopes may be relevant for gastrointestinal cancer progression. Despite the findings obtained so far, further functional studies are still required. Elucidating the precise molecular mechanisms modulated by Gal-1 underlying gastrointestinal tumor progression, might lead to the development of novel Gal-1-based diagnostic methods and/or therapies.</abstracttext>]",['https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmid/28839427/']

ASOs primarily target fat and liver with poor penetrance to other organs. Pharmacological T3 treatment increases energy expenditure and causes weight loss, but is contraindicated for obesity treatment due to systemic effects on multiple organs. We hypothesize that ASO-T3 conjugates may knock down target genes and enrich T3 action in fat and liver. Two established ASOs are tested. Nicotinamide N-methyltransferase (NNMT)-ASO prevents diet-induced obesity in mice. Apolipoprotein B (ApoB)-ASO is an FDA approved drug for treating familial hypercholesterolemia. NNMT-ASO and ApoB-ASO are chemically conjugated with T3 using a non-cleavable sulfo-SMCC linker. Both NNMT-ASO-T3 (NAT3) and ApoB-ASO-T3 (AAT3) enhance thyroid hormone receptor activity. Treating obese mice with NAT3 or AAT3 decreases adiposity and increases lean mass. ASO-T3 enhances white fat browning, decreases genes for fatty acid synthesis in liver, and shows limited effects on T3 target genes in heart and muscle. Furthermore, AAT3 augments LDL cholesterol-lowering effects of ApoB-ASO.

Future predictions can inform health planners and raise awareness of the need for cancer control action. We predicted the future burden of PLC in 30 countries around 2030. Incident cases of PLC (ICD-10 C22) were obtained from 30 countries for 1993-2007. We projected new PLC cases through to 2030 using age-period-cohort models (NORDPRED). Age-standardized incidence rates per 100,000 person-years were calculated by country and sex. Increases in new cases and rates of PLC are projected in both sexes. Among men, the largest increases in rates are in Norway (2.9% per annum), US whites (2.6%), and Canada (2.4%), and among women in the US (blacks 4.0%), Switzerland (3.4%), and Germany (3.0%). The projected declines are in China, Japan, Singapore, and parts of Europe (e.g. in Estonia, Czech Republic, Slovakia). A 35% increase in the number of new cases annually is expected compared to 2005. This increasing burden reflects both increasing rates (and the underlying prevalence of risk factors) and demographic changes. Japan is the only country with a predicted decline in the net number of cases and annual rates by 2030.</abstracttext>, <abstracttext label=""CONCLUSION"" nlmcategory=""CONCLUSIONS"">Our reporting of a projected increase in PLC incidence to 2030 in 30 countries serves as a baseline for anticipated declines in the longer-term via the control of HBV and HCV infections through vaccination and treatment.

One of the critical factors that impedes its successful outcome is the thermal heat sink effects from complex vascular systems that give rise to incomplete destruction of the target tumor tissue, resulting in therapy failure. To better understand the thermal influence of the complex vascular system during RFA, this work proposes the employment of two 3D fractal tree-like branched networks to investigate which key factors of the tree-like vascular system impact heating process. A three-dimensional finite difference analysis is employed to simulate the RFA treatment. Based on the data acquired from the measured experiments, the simulated results derived from combining the Pennes bioheat model and the boundary condition-enforced immersed boundary method (IBM) have demonstrated close agreement with experimental data with a maximum discrepancy of ±8.3%. We employed the orthogonal design approach to analyze 3 factors, namely, the blood vessel's volume, the average distance between probe center and the blood vessel system and the number of the selected part's branches at three different levels. Results have revealed that the distance between RFA probe and blood vessel plays a major role during the heating process compared with the other two factors. In addition, both the ablating rates and the volume of damaged tissue are slightly reduced with increasing number of blood vessel branches.</abstracttext>]",[]

Glial cell-derived tumors and the cells derived from them are highly heterogeneous and variable in their mechanical properties, their response to treatments, and their properties in vitro. Some glioma samples are stiffer than normal brain when measured ex vivo, but even those that are soft in vitro stiffen after deformation by pressure gradients that arise in the tumor environment in vivo. Such mechanical differences can strongly alter the phenotype of cultured glioma cells. Alternatively, chemical signaling might elicit the same phenotype as increased stiffness by activating intracellular messengers common to both initial stimuli. In this study the responses of three different human glioma cell lines to changes in substrate stiffness are compared to their responses on very soft substrates composed of a combination of hyaluronic acid and a specific integrin ligand, either laminin or collagen I. By quantifying cell morphology, stiffness, motility, proliferation, and secretion of the cytokine IL-8, glioma cell responses to increased stiffness are shown to be nearly identically elicited by substrates containing hyaluronic acid, even in the absence of increased stiffness. PI3-kinase activity was required for the response to hyaluronan but not to stiffness. This outcome suggests that hyaluronic acid can trigger the same cellular response as can be obtained by mechanical force transduced from a stiff environment and demonstrates that chemical and mechanical features of the tumor microenvironment can achieve equivalent reactions in cancer cells.</abstracttext>]",[]

Targeted delivery of therapeutic drugs to the tumor-promoting M2-like TAMs is challenging. Here, we developed excellent M2-like TAM dual-targeting nanoparticles (M2NPs), whose structure and function were controlled by α-peptide (a scavenger receptor B type 1 (SR-B1) targeting peptide) linked with M2pep (an M2 macrophage binding peptide). By loading anti-colony stimulating factor-1 receptor (anti-CSF-1R) small interfering RNA (siRNA) on the M2NPs, we developed a molecular-targeted immunotherapeutic approach to specifically block the survival signal of M2-like TAMs and deplete them from melanoma tumors. We confirmed the validity of SR-B1 for M2-like TAM targeting and demonstrated the synergistic effect of the two targeting units (α-peptide and M2pep) in the fusion peptide (α-M2pep). After being administered to tumor-bearing mice, M2NPs had higher affinity to M2-like TAMs than to tissue-resident macrophages in liver, spleen and lung. Compared with control treatment groups, M2NP-based siRNA delivery resulted in a dramatic elimination of M2-like TAMs (52%), decreased tumor size (87%) and prolonged survival. Additionally, this molecular-targeted strategy inhibited immunosuppressive IL-10 and TGF-β production, increased immuno-stimulatory cytokines (IL-12 and IFN-γ) expression and CD8+ T cell infiltration (2.9-fold) in tumor microenvironment. Moreover, the siRNA-carrying M2NPs down-regulated expression of the exhaustion markers (PD-1 and Tim-3) on the infiltrating CD8+ T cells and stimulated their IFN-γ secretion (6.2-fold), indicating the restoration of T cell immune function. Thus, the dual-targeting property of M2NPs combined with RNA interference provide a potential strategy of molecular-targeted cancer immunotherapy for clinical application.</abstracttext>]",[]

Several factors contribute to variations in busulfan drug disposition including bioavailability, age, liver function, genetic polymorphisms, and concurrent administration of other drugs. Busulfan is metabolized by hepatic oxidation via the cytochrome P450 3A4 system as well as through conjugation with glutathione. Interactions with drugs such as phenytoin, itraconazole, and metronidazole have been reported to alter busulfan clearance and result in sub- or supra-therapeutic concentrations. We report a case of a clinically significant drug interaction between intravenous busulfan and the bifunctional T-cell engager, blinatumomab, observed through busulfan therapeutic drug monitoring. We found that busulfan clearance was reduced resulting in a higher area under the concentration-time curve when it was administered 48 h after blinatumomab. Repeat busulfan pharmacokinetic testing two weeks later demonstrated increased clearance of the drug and a 31% higher dose recommendation. Similar to other protein therapeutics, cytokine elevations during blinatumomab treatment can lead to cytochrome 3A4 suppression. We hypothesize that the increased busulfan levels observed could be related to a cytokine-mediated CYP3A4 suppression. This represents a unique pharmacologic consideration in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation which would impact several drugs that undergo CYP3A4 metabolism, including calcineurin inhibitors, cyclophosphamide, sirolimus, and triazole antifungals. Additionally, this mechanism of CYP3A4 suppression may be relevant in treatments and disease states where cytokine levels are elevated such as haploidentical stem cell transplantation, graft-versus-host disease, and use of chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy.</abstracttext>]",[]

In this study, we performed a genome-wide comprehensive analysis of lncRNAs profiling and clinical relevance to identify novel lncRNAs for the further study in CRC. RNA sequencing and microarray data obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) were annotated and analyzed to find differentially expressed lncRNAs in CRC. Analysis of these datasets revealed that hundreds of lncRNAs expression are dysregulated in CRC tissues when compared with normal tissues. By genomic variation analyses, we identified that some of these lncRNAs dysregulation is associated with the copy number amplification or deletion. Moreover, many lncRNAs expression levels are significantly associated with CRC patients overall and recurrence-free survivals, such as H19, LEF1-AS1, and RP11-296E3.2. Furthermore, we identified one liver metastasis-associated lncRNA termed LUCAT1 in CRC by analyzing lncRNAs expression profiles in the CRC tissues from patients with liver metastasis compared with the CRC tissues without metastasis. Finally, loss-of-function assays determined that knockdown of LUCAT1 could impair CRC cells invasion. Taken together, aberrantly expressed lncRNAs may play critical roles in the development and liver metastasis of CRC, and our findings may provide useful resource for identification of novel biomarkers of CRC.</abstracttext>]",[]

Timely detection of this pathology is necessary to delay or interrupt lung cancer progression, ultimately resulting in a possible better prognosis for the patient. In this context, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is especially promising. Ultra-short echo time (UTE) MRI sequences, in combination with gadolinium-based contrast agents, have indeed shown to be especially adapted to the detection of lung neoplastic lesions at submillimeter precision. Manganese-enhanced MRI (MEMRI) increasingly appears to be a possible effective alternative to gadolinium-enhanced MRI. In this work, we investigated whether low-dose MEMRI can effectively target non-small-cell lung cancer in rodents, whilst minimizing the potential toxic effect of manganese. Both systemic and orotracheal administration modalities allowed the identification of tumors of submillimeter size, as confirmed by bioluminescence imaging and histology. Equivalent tumor signal enhancements and contrast-to-noise ratios were observed with orotracheal administration using 20 times lower doses compared with the more conventional systemic route. This finding is of crucial importance as it supports the observation that higher performances of contrast agents can be obtained using an orotracheal administration route when targeting lung diseases. As a consequence, lower concentrations of contrast media can be employed, reducing the dose and potential safety issues. The non-detectable accumulation of ionic manganese in the brain and liver following orotracheal administration observed in vivo is extremely encouraging with regard to the safety of the orotracheal protocol with low-dose Mn<sup>2+</sup> administration. To our knowledge, this is the first time that a study has clearly allowed the high-precision detection of lung tumor and its contours via the synergic employment of a strongly T<sub>1</sub> -weighted MRI UTE sequence and ionic manganese, an inexpensive contrast agent.

Given the relevant pathogenic role of mitochondrial and fatty acid metabolism in hepatocarcinoma (HCC), here we pointed to PGC-1β as a putative novel transcriptional player in the development and progression of HCC. For this purpose, we generated both hepatic-specific PGC-1β overexpressing (LivPGC-1β) and PGC-1β knockout (LivPGC-1βKO) mice, and we challenged them with both chemical and genetic models of hepatic carcinogenesis. Our results demonstrate a pivotal role of PGC-1β in driving liver tumor development. Indeed, whereas mice overexpressing PGC-1β show greater tumor susceptibility, PGC-1β knockout mice are protected from carcinogenesis. High levels of PGC-1β are able to boost ROS scavenger expression, therefore limiting the detrimental ROS accumulation and, consequently, apoptosis. Moreover, it supports tumor anabolism, enhancing the expression of genes involved in fatty acid and triglyceride synthesis. Accordingly, the specific hepatic ablation of PGC-1β promotes the accumulation of ROS-driven macromolecule damage, finally limiting tumor growth . The present data elect hepatic PGC-1β as a transcriptional gatekeeper of mitochondrial function and redox status in HCC, orchestrating different metabolic programs that allow tumor progression.

The pre- and post-operative livers are first aligned by a rigid registration based on a convex hull. In the non-rigid registrations, local incompressible constraints are then set on the liver and the ablation area to estimate the deformations caused by respiratory movement and edema, respectively. The concatenation of the rigid and non-rigid deformations is used to warp the ablation area on the pre-operative liver.</abstracttext>, <abstracttext label=""RESULTS"" nlmcategory=""RESULTS"">The proposed method was evaluated using clinical CT datasets from 20 patients. The Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) between the pre-operative and warped post-operative livers is 94.35%, the mean surface distance (MSD) between the livers is 1.65 mm, the mean hausdorff distance (HDD) between the livers is 3.36 mm, and the mean corresponding distance (MCD) between the corresponding landmarks is 1.70 mm.

Results Expression of serum UCA1 was significantly higher in patients with HCC and allowed for discrimination of HCC from BLD and healthy controls. High expression of serum UCA1 was significantly associated with a high tumor grade, large tumor size, positive vascular invasion, and advanced TNM stage. Multivariate analysis revealed that a high serum UCA1 level was an independent unfavorable prognostic factor for HCC.

Variables that exhibited a potential association were evaluated by multivariable logistic regression analysis to identify those independently associated with postoperative morbidity. Between January 2012 and March 2012, 100 patients underwent hepatic resection for liver metastases from colorectal carcinoma at the Treviso Regional Hospital (Treviso, Italy) and at the Regina Elena National Cancer Institute (Rome, Italy).

Recently we have shown that BCD has an anti-inflammatory effect on CC via suppression of the inflammasome and liver X receptor activation. The putative effects of BCD on CC-induced complement activation remain unknown. In this study, we found that BCD bound to CC and reduced deposition of Igs, pattern recognition molecules, and complement factors on CC in human plasma. Furthermore, BCD decreased complement activation as measured by terminal complement complex and lowered the expression of complement receptors on monocytes in whole blood in response to CC exposure. In line with this, BCD also reduced reactive oxygen species formation caused by CC in whole blood. Furthermore, BCD attenuated the CC-induced proinflammatory cytokine responses (e.g., IL-1α, MIP-1α, TNF, IL-6, and IL-8) as well as regulated a range of CC-induced genes in human PBMC. BCD also regulated complement-related genes in human carotid plaques treated ex vivo. Formation of terminal complement complex on other complement-activating structures such as monosodium urate crystals and zymosan was not affected by BCD.

Given the activating role that some PTKs play in initiating growth factor-mediated cellular processes, PTPs are usually perceived as the negative regulators of these events and therefore tumor suppressive in nature. However, mounting evidence indicate that PTPs do not always antagonize the activity of PTKs in regulating tyrosine phosphorylation, but can also play dominant roles in the initiation and progression of signaling cascades that regulate cell functions. It follows therefore that PTP malfunction can actively contribute to a host of human disorders in particular: cancer, metabolic syndromes and autoimmune diseases. The Src homology domain containing phosphatase 2 (SHP2) and the three-membered family of phosphatases of regenerating liver (PRLs) are infamously oncogenic members of the PTP superfamily. Both are established regulators of major cancer pathways such as Ras/ERK1/2, Src, JAK/STAT, JNK, NF-κB, and PTEN/PI3K/AKT.

It is highly refractory to most systemic therapies. Recently, significant progress has been made in uncovering genomic alterations in HCC, including potentially targetable aberrations. The most common molecular anomalies in this malignancy are mutations in the TERT promoter, TP53, CTNNB1, AXIN1, ARID1A, CDKN2A and CCND1 genes. PTEN loss at the protein level is also frequent. Genomic portfolios stratify by risk factors as follows: (i) CTNNB1 with alcoholic cirrhosis; and (ii) TP53 with hepatitis B virus-induced cirrhosis. Activating mutations in CTNNB1 and inactivating mutations in AXIN1 both activate WNT signaling. Alterations in this pathway, as well as in TP53 and the cell cycle machinery, and in the PI3K/Akt/mTor axis (the latter activated in the presence of PTEN loss), as well as aberrant angiogenesis and epigenetic anomalies, appear to be major events in HCC. Many of these abnormalities may be pharmacologically tractable. Immunotherapy with checkpoint inhibitors is also emerging as an important treatment option. Indeed, 82% of patients express PD-L1 (immunohistochemistry) and response rates to anti-PD-1 treatment are about 19%, and include about 5% complete remissions as well as durable benefit in some patients.

The aim of this report is to perform a pooled analysis evaluating the risk ratio (RR) of AA-related adverse events of special interest associated with low or standard dose of corticosteroids.

An aptamer is a short single-stranded DNA selected from a synthetic DNA library that is capable of binding to its target with high affinity and specificity based on its unique DNA sequence and 3D structure after folding. Similar to the BBC assay, Cyto-c is captured by a micro-magnetic particle (MMP) coated with capturing antibodies (Ab) and an aptamer specifically against Cyto-c to form sandwich structures ([MMP-Ab]-[Cyto-c]-[Aptamer]). After washing and melting, our aptamers, acting as a DNA bio-barcode, are released from the sandwiches and hybridized with the probes specially designed for RNase H for surface plasmon resonance (SPR) sensing. In an aptamer-probe duplex, RNase H digests the RNA in the probe and releases the intact aptamer for another round of hybridization and digestion. With signal enhancement effects from gold-nanorods (Au-NRs) on probes for SPR sensing, the detection limit was found to be 1 nM for the aptamer and 80 pM for Cyto-c. Without the time-consuming DNA amplification steps by PCR, the detection process of this new ABC assay can be completed within three hours. As a proof-of-concept, phenylarsine oxide was found to be a potent agent to kill liver cancer cells with multi-drug resistance at the nano-molar level. This approach thus provides a fast, sensitive and robust tool for anti-cancer drug screening.</abstracttext>]",['http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c7an01026e']

Interference with lysosome acidification using ammonium chloride, a weak base, or concanamycin A, a vacuolar H<sup>+</sup> ATPase inhibitor, decreased amebic trogocytosis and amebic cytotoxicity. Our data suggest that the inhibitors do not impair the ingestion of an initial fragment but rather block continued trogocytosis and the ingestion of multiple fragments.

We aimed to investigate the role of 3'-untranslated (3'-UTR) and 5'-untranslated regions (5'-UTR) in post-transcriptional regulation of MICB. Nine novel microRNAs (miRNAs) predicted to interact with 3'-UTR and 5'-UTR using TargetScan, RNAhybrid and miBridge were identified.

Additionally, activated HSCs may participate in the formation of the tumor microenvironment. Polaprezinc, a protector of the gastric mucosa, has been recently demonstrated to be an inhibitor of liver fibrosis in a mouse model. Proliferation and colony formation assays were performed to determine the inhibitory effects of polaprezinc on the growth of LX‑2 and hepG2 cells. A migration assay was used to evaluate the change in mobility of LX‑2 cells and quantitative polymerase chain reaction was performed to detect the expression levels of key markers of fibrosis. Finally, a gene chip assay for polaprezinc‑treated hepG2 cells was performed to evaluate the effect of polaprezinc on the hepG2 gene expression profile. The proliferation assay indicated that polaprezinc may inhibit the LX‑2 cell proliferation and the migration assays confirmed the inhibition of mobility. The expression levels of fibrotic markers such as collagen I, fibronectin and α‑smooth muscle actin were downregulated following polaprezinc treatment. The proliferation activity of polaprezinc‑treated hepG2 cells was reduced and the gene chip assay indicated that series of gene expression changes associated with cancer migration, cell skeletal organization and proliferation had occurred.

Here, we report that c‑Myc plays an important role in abrogating contact inhibition in human cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) cells. Our data show that the protein level of c‑Myc obviously decreased in contact-inhibited normal biliary epithelial cells. However, CCA cells sustain high protein levels of c‑Myc and keep strong proliferation ability in confluent conditions. Importantly, the suppression of c‑Myc by inhibitor or siRNA induced G0/G1 phase cell cycle arrest in confluent CCA cells. We demonstrate that the inhibition of c‑Myc suppressed the activity of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) in confluent CCA cells, and mTOR inhibition induced G0/G1 phase cell cycle arrest in confluent CCA cells. In confluent CCA cells, the activity of Merlin is downregulated, and Yes-associated protein (YAP) sustains high levels of activity. Furthermore, YAP inhibition not only induced G0/G1 phase cell cycle arrest, but also decreased c‑Myc expression in confluent CCA cells. These results indicate that Merlin/YAP/c‑Myc/mTOR signaling axis promotes human CCA cell proliferation by overriding contact inhibition.

Eating raw, fermented, or undercooked cyprinid fish, infected with the liver fluke, <i>Opisthorchis viverrini</i> sensu lato (sl), results in chronic biliary inflammation, periductal fibrosis, and increased cancer risk. There may be associated glomerulonephritis. The process of infection is difficult to disrupt because eating practices have proven extremely difficult to change, and the life cycle of the fluke cannot be broken due to high prevalence in canine and feline reservoir hosts. Fecal analysis and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay tests can be used to diagnose opisthorchiasis. Diagnosis of CCA is complex, partly due to the lack of definitive imaging characteristics but also due to the difficulty of obtaining samples for cytology or histology. This cancer has proven to be resistant to common chemotherapy treatments and so the two avenues of treatment available are surgical resection and liver transplantation, both requiring early detection of the tumor for the best chances of success. Late presentation of symptoms reduces the chances of successful surgical intervention. While liver fluke infections can be treated with praziquantel, individuals will often become reinfected, and multiple reinfections can be more harmful than a singular, long-term infection.

To date, hydrogel-encapsulated cells have been successfully incorporated into 3D printed microfluidic devices. However, there is currently no 3D printed microfluidic device that can support multicellular spheroid culture, which facilitates extensive cell-cell contacts important for recapitulating many multicellular functional biological structures. Here, we report a first instance of fabricating a 3D printed microfluidic cell culture device capable of directly immobilizing and maintaining the viability and functionality of 3D multicellular spheroids. We evaluated the feasibility of two common 3D printing technologies i.e. stereolithography (SLA) and PolyJet printing, and found that SLA could prototype a device comprising of cell immobilizing micro-structures that were housed within a microfluidic network with higher fidelity. We have also implemented a pump-free perfusion system, relying on gravity-driven flow to perform medium perfusion in order to reduce the complexity and footprint of the device setup, thereby improving its adaptability into a standard biological laboratory. Finally, we demonstrated the biological performance of the 3D printed device by performing pump-free perfusion cultures of patient-derived parental and metastatic oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) tumor and liver cell (HepG2) spheroids with good cell viability and functionality. This paper presents a proof-of-concept in simplifying and integrating the prototyping and operation of a microfluidic spheroid culture device, which will facilitate its applications in various drug efficacy, metabolism and toxicity studies.</abstracttext>]",['https://doi.org/10.1088/1758-5090/aa8858']

Several FLD detection and characterization systems using machine learning (ML) based on Support Vector Machines (SVM) have been applied. These ML systems utilize large number of ultrasonic grayscale features, pooling strategy for selecting the best features and several combinations of training/testing. As result, they are computationally intensive, slow and do not guarantee high performance due to mismatch between grayscale features and classifier type. This study proposes a reliable and fast Extreme Learning Machine (ELM)-based tissue characterization system (a class of Symtosis) for risk stratification of ultrasound liver images. ELM is used to train single layer feed forward neural network (SLFFNN). The input-to-hidden layer weights are randomly generated reducing computational cost. The only weights to be trained are hidden-to-output layer which is done in a single pass (without any iteration) making ELM faster than conventional ML methods. Adapting four types of K-fold cross-validation (K = 2, 3, 5 and 10) protocols on three kinds of data sizes: S0-original, S4-four splits, S8-sixty four splits (a total of 12 cases) and 46 types of grayscale features, we stratify the FLD US images using ELM and benchmark against SVM. Using the US liver database of 63 patients (27 normal/36 abnormal), our results demonstrate superior performance of ELM compared to SVM, for all cross-validation protocols (K2, K3, K5 and K10) and all types of US data sets (S0, S4, and S8) in terms of sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and area under the curve (AUC). Using the K10 cross-validation protocol on S8 data set, ELM showed an accuracy of 96.75% compared to 89.01% for SVM, and correspondingly, the AUC: 0.97 and 0.91, respectively. Further experiments also showed the mean reliability of 99% for ELM classifier, along with the mean speed improvement of 40% using ELM against SVM.

LCs belong to the subset of leukocytes called dendritic cells. They are present in the epidermis and the pilosebaceous apparatus and monitor the cutaneous environment for changes in homeostasis. During embryogenesis, a wave of yolk-sac macrophages seed the fetal skin. Then, fetal liver monocytes largely replace the yolk-sac macrophages and comprise the majority of adult LCs. In the presence of skin irritation, LCs process antigen and travel to regional lymph nodes to present antigen to reactive T lymphocytes. Changes in LCs' surface markers during the journey occur under the influence of cytokines. The difference in expression of surface markers and the ability to resist radiation have allowed researchers to differentiate LCs from the murine Langerin-positive dermal dendritic cells. Exciting discoveries have been made recently regarding their role in inflammatory skin diseases, cancer, and HIV. New research has shown that antibodies blocking CD1a appear to mitigate inflammation in contact hypersensitivity reactions and psoriasis. While it has been established that LCs have the potential to induce effector cells of the adaptive immune system to counter oncogenesis, recent studies have demonstrated that LCs coordinate with natural killer cells to impair development of squamous cell carcinoma caused by chemical carcinogens. However, LCs may also physiologically suppress T cells and permit keratinocyte transformation and tumorigenesis. Although long known to play a primary role in the progression of HIV infection, it is now understood that LCs also possess the ability to restrict the progression of the disease. There is a pressing need to discover more about how these cells affect various aspects of health and disease; new information gathered thus far seems promising and exciting.

However, the therapeutic effect of sorafenib is transient and patients invariably develop sorafenib resistance (SR). Recently, TYRO3, a member of the TAM family of receptor tyrosine kinases, was identified as being aberrantly expressed in a significant proportion of HCC, however its role in SR is unknown. In this study, we generated two functionally distinct sorafenib resistant human Huh-7 HCC cell lines, in order to identify new mechanisms to abrogate acquired SR, as well as new potential therapeutic targets in HCC. Initially, we investigated the effects of a microRNA, miR-7, in both in vitro and in vivo preclinical models of human HCC and identified miR-7 as a potent tumour suppressor of human HCC. We identified TYRO3 as a new functional target of miR-7, which regulates proliferation, migration and invasion of Huh-7 cells via the PI3-Kinase/AKT pathway and is markedly elevated upon acquisition of SR. Furthermore, miR-7 effectively silenced TYRO3 expression in both sorafenib-sensitive and sorafenib-resistant Huh-7 cells inhibiting TYRO3/GAS6 mediated cancer cell migration and invasion. In conclusion, we identified a novel mechanism for acquiring SR in HCC which is via the aberrant expression of the TYRO3/PI3-Kinase/AKT signal transduction pathway, a mechanism that can be overcome by miR-7 over-expression.

Many studies have shown that insulin resistance is a risk factor for HCC. We previously discovered the overexpression and oncogenic role of the Reptin/RUVBL2 ATPase in HCC. Here, we found that Reptin silencing enhanced insulin sensitivity in 2 HCC cell lines, as shown by a large potentiation of insulin-induced AKT phosphorylation on Ser473 and Thr308, and of downstream signalling. Reptin silencing did not affect the tyrosine phosphorylation of the insulin receptor nor of IRS1, but it enhanced the tyrosine phosphorylation of the p85 subunit of PI3K. The expression of the SHP-1/PTPN6 phosphatase, which dephosphorylates p85, was reduced after Reptin depletion. Forced expression of SHP-1 restored a normal AKT phosphorylation after insulin treatment in cells where Reptin was silenced, demonstrating that the downregulation of SHP1 is mechanistically linked to increased Akt phosphorylation. In conclusion, we have uncovered a new function for Reptin in regulating insulin signalling in HCC cells via the regulation of SHP-1 expression. We suggest that the regulation of insulin sensitivity by Reptin contributes to its oncogenic action in the liver.</abstracttext>]",[]

Three years later, she presented with a solitary liver lesion on MRI, which was highly suspicious of malignancy. However, several fine needle biopsies were performed, and histopathological examination revealed no signs of neoplasia. As a result of these alarming discrepancies, the multidisciplinary board recommended a diag-nostic laparotomy, which yielded a finding consistent with reactive lymphoid hyperplasia, a pseudolymphoma of the liver, on a background of incipient steatohepatitis. This rare condition is characterized by proliferation of non-neoplastic lymphocytes in extranodular sites, and is usually an incidental finding on imaging modalities in clinically asymptomatic patients, predominantly women. Lesions share some radiologic features with primary malignant liver diseases such as hepatocellular carcinoma or cholangiocarcinoma. Although the etiology remains unclear, reactive lymphoid hyperplasia is believed to be associated with some malignancies, including breast cancer, or inflammatory and autoimmune disorders.

Among several types of theasinensins, theasinensin A (TSA), an epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) dimer with an R-biphenyl bond, is the most abundant theasinensin prevalent in oolong tea. Previous studies have reported that TSA exhibits antioxidative, anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer activities in vitro and in vivo. However, little is known about the hepatoprotective effect of TSA. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate the inhibitory effect of TSA on carbon tetrachloride (CCl<sub>4</sub>)-induced hepatic fibrosis in mice. After intraperitoneal injection of CCl<sub>4</sub> for eight weeks, histological lesions in the liver tissue and elevated serum levels of alanine aminotransferase and alkaline phosphatase were found in mice. Conversely, oral administration of TSA relieved CCl<sub>4</sub>-induced liver injury as well as ameliorated liver functions. Our immunohistochemical staining results revealed that collagen deposition was profoundly reduced due to supplementation with TSA. In addition, we also found that hepatic α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) and matrix metallopeptidase 9 (MMP-9) expression was suppressed through the inhibition of transforming growth factor β (TGF-β). Taken together, our current findings suggest that TSA may serve as a potent bioactive constituent from oolong tea that acts against liver fibrosis through the inhibition of hepatic stellate cell (HSC) activation.</abstracttext>]",['http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c7fo00700k']

Selectins control the first step in immune cell adhesion and extravasation, thereby guiding leukocyte trafficking to tissue lesions. We analyzed four different highly specific selectin-binding glycopolymers, based on linear poly(2-hydroxypropyl)-methacrylamide (PHPMA) polymers. These glycopolymers contain either the tetrasaccharide sialyl-Lewis<sup>X</sup> (SLe<sup>X</sup>) or the individual carbohydrates fucose, galactose, and sialic acids mimicking the complex SLe<sup>X</sup> binding motive. The glycopolymers strongly bind to primary human macrophages, without activating them, and also to primary human blood leukocytes, but poorly to fibroblasts and endothelial cells in vitro. After intravenous injection in mice, all glycopolymers accumulated in the liver without causing hepatotoxicity. The glycosylated binder most potently targeted resident hepatic macrophages (Kupffer cells) and protected mice from acute toxic liver injury in the two different experimental models, carbon tetrachloride (CCl<sub>4</sub>) or Concanavalin A (ConA)-based hepatitis. Its sulfated counterpart, on the other hand, induced a decrease in infiltrating and resident macrophages, increased T helper cells, and aggravated immune-mediated liver injury. We demonstrate that, in the context of selectin-binding glycopolymers, minor modifications strongly impact leukocyte influx and macrophage activation, thereby ameliorating or aggravating liver inflammation depending on the underlying immunopathology. The nonsulfated random glycopolymer is a promising candidate for the treatment of inflammatory disease. The modulation of hepatic immune cells by selectin-binding glycopolymers might breach the immunosuppressive hepatic microenvironment and could improve efficacy of immunotherapies for inflammatory disease and cancer.</abstracttext>]",['https://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsnano.7b04630']

Follow-up observation was performed on cirrhosis patients. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) was adopted to detect the serums of patients, and the serum polypeptides with a potential value in early HCC warning and diagnosis were screened. Electrospray ionization quadrupole time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry (ESI-Q-TOF-MS/MS) was exploited to identify these screened polypeptides. Moreover, the serum marker concentration was determined by ELISA to validate the clinical value of the serum marker. Among 109 cirrhosis patients followed up for two years, 29 patients (26.6%) finally progressed into HCC. MALDI-TOF MS shows that the concentration of a 3155.66Da polypeptide was significantly different between the patients that progressed into HCC and those not. Through MS/MS identification, it is confirmed that the polypeptide is inter-alpha-trypsin inhibitor heavy chain 4 (ITIH4).

In addition, GS25 was found to potently suppress the expression of endogenous STAT3 at a higher concentration and dramatically induce p38 phosphorylation in HepG2 cells, which could mediate its anti-cancer effects. Finally, we demonstrated that GS25 also inhibited tumor growth in HepG2 xenograft mice. Taken together, these findings indicate that GS25 elicits its anti-cancer effects on HepG2 cells through multiple mechanisms and has the potential to be used as an inhibitor of IL-6 signaling. Thus, GS25 may be developed as a treatment for hepatocarcinoma with low toxicity on normal liver tissues as well as other inflammation-associated diseases.</abstracttext>]","[<div class=""keywords""><h4>KEYWORDS: </h4><p>25-OCH3-PPD; Anti-tumor effects; Apoptosis; ERK; HepG2; STAT3</p></div>]",[],[]

The engineered scaffold protein ABD-.derived affinity protein (ADAPT) is a promising tracer for radionuclide molecular imaging due to its small size (6.5 kDa), that provides precondition for efficient tumor penetration and rapid clearance. Previous studies demonstrated that the human epidermal growth factor receptor type 2 (HER2)-targeting ADAPT6 labeled with radiometals at the N-terminus provides imaging of HER2 expression in xenografts a few hours after injection. The aim of this study was to evaluate if the use of a non-residualizing label or placement of the labels at the C-terminus would further improve targeting properties of ADAPT6. <b>Methods:</b> Two constructs, Cys2-ADAPT6 and Cys59-ADAPT6, having the (HE)3DANS-sequence at the N-terminus were produced and site-specifically labeled using <sup>111</sup>In-DOTA or <sup>125</sup>I-iodo-((4-hydroxyphenyl)ethyl) maleimide (HPEM). The conjugates were compared in vitro and in vivo. HER2 targeting properties and biodistribution were evaluated in BALB/C nu/nu mice bearing ovarian carcinoma cells (SKOV-3) xenografts. <b>Results:</b> Specific HER2-binding and high affinity was preserved after labeling. Both Cys2-ADAPT6 and Cys59-ADAPT6 were internalized slowly by HER2-expressing cancer cells. Depending on the label position, the tumor uptake at 4 h after injection varied in the range of 10-22 %ID/g. Regardless of terminus position, the <sup>125</sup>I-HPEM label provided more than 140-fold lower renal uptake in comparison with the <sup>111</sup>In-DOTA label at 4 after injection. The tumor-to-organ ratios were on the contrary higher for both the <sup>111</sup>In-DOTA labeled ADAPT variants in other organs. Tumor-to-blood ratios for <sup>111</sup>In-labeled Cys2-ADAPT6 and Cys59-ADAPT6 did not differ significantly (250-280) but <sup>111</sup>In-DOTA-Cys59-ADAPT6 provided significantly higher tumor-to-lung, tumor-to-liver, tumor-to-spleen and tumor-to-muscle ratios. Radioiodinated variants had similar tumor-to-organ ratios, but <sup>125</sup>I-HPEM-Cys59-ADAPT6 had significantly higher tumor uptake and higher tumor-to-kidney ratio. <b>Conclusion:</b> Residualizing properties of the label have strong influence on the targeting properties of ADAPT6. The position of the radiolabel influences targeting as well, although to lesser extent. Placement of a label at C-terminus provides the best biodistribution features for both radiometal and radiohalogen labels.

Intraarterial therapy options for colorectal liver metastases include chemoinfusion via a hepatic arterial pump or port, irinotecan-loaded drug-eluting beads, and radioembolization using <sup>90</sup>Y microspheres. Intraarterial therapy allows the delivery of a high dose of chemotherapy or radiation into liver tumors while minimizing the impact on liver parenchyma and avoiding systemic effects. Specificity in intraarterial therapy can be achieved both through preferential arterial flow to the tumor and through selective catheter positioning. In this review, we discuss indications, contraindications, preprocedure evaluation, activity prescription, follow-up, outcomes, and complications of radioembolization of colorectal liver metastases. Methods for preventing off-target embolization, increasing the specificity of microsphere delivery, and reducing the lung-shunt fraction are discussed. There are 2 types of <sup>90</sup>Y microspheres: resin and glass. Because glass microspheres have a higher activity per particle, they can deliver a particular radiation dose with fewer particles, likely reducing embolic effects. Glass microspheres thus may be more suitable when early stasis or reflux is a concern, in the setting of hepatocellular carcinoma with portal vein invasion, and for radiation segmentectomy. Because resin microspheres have a lower activity per particle, more particles are needed to deliver a particular radiation dose. Resin microspheres thus may be preferable for larger tumors and those with high arterial flow. In addition, resin microspheres have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for colorectal liver metastases, whereas institutional review board approval is required before glass microspheres can be used under a compassionate-use or research protocol. Finally, radiation segmentectomy involves delivering a calculated lobar activity of <sup>90</sup>Y microspheres selectively to treat a tumor involving 1 or 2 liver segments. This technique administers a very high radiation dose and effectively causes the ablation of tumors that are too large or are in a location considered unsafe for thermal ablation. The selective delivery spares surrounding normal liver, reducing the risk of liver failure.</abstracttext>]","[<div class=""keywords""><h4>KEYWORDS: </h4><p>90Y; colorectal cancer; irinotecan-loaded drug-eluting beads; liver metastases; microspheres; radioembolization</p></div>]",[],[]

Exogenous overexpression of miR-210-3p inhibited the proliferation, migration and invasion of bladder cancer cells in vitro. In addition, the nude mouse xenograft model showed that miR-210-3p over-expressing inhibited bladder cancer growth and liver metastasis whereas silencing miR-210-3p caused an opposite outcome, which is mainly regulated by targeting fibroblast growth factor receptor-like 1 (FGFRL1). We also demonstrated that the expression of FGFRL1 in bladder cancer specimens were negatively correlated with miR-210-3p level, and FGFRL1 overexpression rescued the cell proliferation and invasion inhibited by ectopic expression of miR-210-3p. Moreover, knockdown of FGFRL1 was able to mimic the cell growth and metastasis effects induced by miR-210-3p over-expressing in bladder cancer cells.

Loss-of-function mutations in genes encoding either transporter induce hereditary manganese toxicity. Patients have elevated manganese in blood and brain, and develop neurotoxicity. Liver manganese is increased in patients lacking SLC30A10, but not SLC39A14. These organ-specific changes in manganese were recently recapitulated in knockout mice. Surprisingly, Slc30a10 knockouts also had elevated thyroid manganese and developed hypothyroidism. To determine the mechanisms of manganese-induced hypothyroidism and understand how SLC30A10 and SLC39A14 cooperatively mediate manganese detoxification, here we produced Slc39a14 single and Slc30a10/Slc39a14 double knockout mice and compared their phenotypes with those of Slc30a10 single knockouts. Compared with wildtype controls, Slc39a14 single and Slc30a10/Slc39a14 double knockouts had higher manganese levels in the blood and brain, but not the liver. In contrast, Slc30a10 single knockouts had elevated manganese in the liver as well as in the blood and brain. Furthermore, SLC30A10 and SLC39A14 localized to the canalicular and basolateral domains of polarized hepatic cells, respectively. Thus, transport activities of both SLC39A14 and SLC30A10 are required for hepatic manganese excretion. Compared with Slc30a10 single knockouts, Slc39a14 single and Slc30a10/Slc39a14 double knockouts had lower thyroid manganese levels and had normal thyroid function. Moreover, intra-thyroid thyroxine levels of Slc30a10 single knockouts were lower than those of controls. Thus, the hypothyroidism phenotype of Slc30a10 single knockouts is induced by elevated thyroid manganese, which blocks thyroxine production. These findings provide new insights into the mechanisms of manganese detoxification and manganese-induced thyroid dysfunction.</abstracttext>]","[<div class=""keywords""><h4>KEYWORDS: </h4><p>SLC30; SLC39; cation diffusion facilitator; excretion; liver; manganese; metal homeostasis; parkinsonism; thyroid; transporter</p></div>]",[],[]

Hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection are well-known leading causes of HCC. However, the mechanism of the induction of HCC by these virus is still being debated. This review will focus on the current knowledge of the pathogenesis of HBV- and HCV-induced inflammation and the role of such immune activation in the tumorigenesis of HCC. It is well established that the recruitment of certain number and type of immune cells to liver is essential for the resolution of HBV and HCV infection and the prevention of subsequent chronic persistent infection. However, in case that the immune response do not completely clear virus, persistent chronic infection occurs, and the perpetual immune response may contribute to chronic damages of the liver. Such chronic inflammatory damages further harm hepatocytes, but not hepatic progenitor cells (HPCs). Thus, following chronic damages, HPCs are activated and their dysregulated proliferation ensures survival in the hostile environment, contributing to the tumorigenesis of HCC. Furthermore, accumulating evidence also provides a strong link between HPCs and human hepatocellular carcinoma. Collectively, these findings support a notion that immune response is involved in liver damage during hepatitis virus infection, and the activation and dysregulated differentiation of hepatic progenitor cells promote the tumorigenesis of human hepatocellular carcinoma.</abstracttext>]","[<div class=""keywords""><h4>KEYWORDS: </h4><p>Hepatic progenitor cells; Hepatocellular carcinoma; Immune response; Liver injury</p></div>]",[],[]

An age-, sex-, index year-, and diabetes mellitus (DM)-matched control cohort of 70,124 persons without PLA was selected from the same dataset. Both cohorts were followed up until the end of 2011. The risk of PLC was estimated for both cohorts.The incidence of PLC was nearly 2-fold greater in the PLA group than in the control cohort (29.3 per 10,000 person-years vs. 16.2 per 10,000 person-years). The incidences of HCC and ICC were 1.5- (22.1 per 10,000 person-years vs. 15.0 per 10,000 person-years) and 11-fold greater (6.73 per 10,000 person-years vs. 0.62 per 10,000 person-years), respectively, in the PLA group than in the control cohort. The PLA cohort also had high risks of PLC (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] = 1.56; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.35-1.81), HCC (aHR = 1.34; 95% CI = 1.15-1.57), and ICC (aHR = 6.94; 95% CI = 4.23-11.57).In conclusion, in this nationwide cohort study, PLA increased the risk of delayed-onset PLC.</abstracttext>]",[],[],['http://Insights.ovid.com/pubmed?pmid=28834881']

Estetrol (E4) is a natural estrogen synthesized exclusively during pregnancy by the human fetal liver and initially considered as a weak estrogen. However, E4 was recently evaluated in a phase I-II clinical studies and found to act as an oral contraceptive in combination with a progestin, without increasing the level of coagulation factors. We recently showed that E4 stimulates uterine epithelial proliferation through nuclear estrogen receptor (ER) α, but failed to elicit endothelial responses. Here, we first evaluated the morphological and functional impacts of E4 on the vagina of ovariectomized mice and we determined the molecular mechanism mediating these effects. Vaginal epithelial proliferation and lubrication after stimulation were found to increase following E4 chronic treatment. Using the combination of pharmacological and genetic approaches, we demonstrated that these E4 effects on vagina are mediated by nuclear ERα activation.

Besides palliative effects of cannabinoids used in cancer treatment, phytocannabinoids, synthetic agonists, as well as substances that increase endogenous endocannabinoid levels have gained interest as potential agents for systemic cancer treatment. Accordingly, cannabinoid compounds have been reported to inhibit tumor growth and spreading in numerous rodent models. The underlying mechanisms include induction of apoptosis, autophagy, and cell cycle arrest in tumor cells as well as inhibition of tumor cell invasion and angiogenic features of endothelial cells. In addition, cannabinoids have been shown to suppress epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, to enhance tumor immune surveillance, and to support chemotherapeutics' effects on drug-resistant cancer cells. However, unwanted side effects include psychoactivity and possibly pathogenic effects on liver health. Other cannabinoids such as the nonpsychoactive cannabidiol exert a comparatively good safety profile while exhibiting considerable anticancer properties. So far experience with anticarcinogenic effects of cannabinoids is confined to in vitro studies and animal models.

Augmenter of liver regeneration (ALR), previously also known as 'hepatic stimulator substance', is reported to inhibit the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in HCC, one of the frequent events that occur in cancer metastasis, suggesting that ALR is involved in HCC. In this study, we report for the first time that the transfection of ALR enhances the antitumor effect of chemotherapy with doxorubicin, a typical anticancer drug, on HCC in vitro and in vivo. The efflux of doxorubicin from ALR-transfected HCC cells is efficiently suppressed. This implies the intracellular retention of doxorubicin in tumor cells, which is at least partly attributable to the effective inhibition of ABCB1 and ABCG2 transporter expression in ALR-expressing cells. The downregulation of ALR expression by short hairpin RNA diminishes the antitumor effect of ALR. We further demonstrate that ALR inhibits the AKT/Snail signaling pathway, resulting in the downregulation of ABCB1 and ABCG2 expression.

However, the precisely roles of TRIM35 during virus infection still remained largely unknown. In the current study, we cloned a TRIM35 gene from orange spotted grouper (EcTRIM35) and uncovered its roles in response to nodavirus infection. EcTRIM35 encoded a 456-aa protein which showed 65% and 32% identity to large yellow croaker (Larimichthys crocea) and human (Homo sapiens), respectively. Structure prediction and amino acid alignment analysis indicated that EcTRIM35 contained three conserved domains, including RING domain, B-BOX and SPRY domain. In healthy grouper, the high expression level of EcTRIM35 could be detected in liver, spleen and intestine. After infection with red-spotted grouper nervous necrosis (RGNNV) and Singapore grouper iridovirus (SGIV) in GS cells, the transcript of EcTRIM35 was significantly up-regulated with the infection time increased. Under fluorescence microscopy, the bright fluorescence aggregates were observed in EcTRIM35 transfected cells, but the fluorescence distribution was obviously altered in the EcTRIM35-ΔRING transfected cells. After incubation with RGNNV, the overexpression of EcTRIM35 in vitro significantly enhanced the viral replication, evidenced by the enhancement of cytopathic effect (CPE) severity and the up-regulation of the viral gene transcription. Moreover, the ectopic expression of EcTRIM35 significantly decreased the expression of interferon signaling molecules or effectors. Further studies elucidated that EcTRIM35 overexpression significantly weakened the MAVS-, MITA- or TBK1-induced interferon immune response, but showed no effects on MDA5-induced immune response. Thus, our results will shed new lights on the roles of fish TRIM35 in innate immune response against grouper virus infection.</abstracttext>]","[<div class=""keywords""><h4>KEYWORDS: </h4><p>Antiviral; Grouper; Interferon; Nodavirus; TRIM35</p></div>]",[],['https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1050-4648(17)30482-5']

In this study, we investigated a novel pseudogene, PDIA3P1, which was upregulated in HCC tissues compared with paired normal adjacent tissues. The expression of PDIA3P1 was significantly correlated with tumor size, metastasis, TNM stage, and overall stage. Knockdown of PDIA3P1decreased proliferation, migration, and invasion of HCC cells.

Candidate miRNAs targeting the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) of CYP1A2 were screened in silico, resulting in the selection of sixty-two potential miRNAs for further analysis. The levels of two miRNAs, hsa-miR-132-5p and hsa-miR-221-5p, were inversely correlated with the expression of CYP1A2 mRNA transcripts in normal human liver tissue samples represented in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset.

Here we characterize major pathways regulating this atypical EMT through whole genome transcriptome profiling and molecular analysis, and identify a unique regulation of EMT by GSK-3β. Our analysis reveals remarkable suppression of several key liver-specific markers in Huh7.5M cells indicating that EMT not only changes the epithelial properties, but alters the characteristics associated with hepatocytes as well. One key finding of this study is that GSK-3β, a known antagonist to β-Catenin signaling and a major pro-apoptotic regulator, is critical for the maintenance of EMT in Huh7.5M cells as its inhibition reversed EMT. Importantly, through these studies we identify that maintenance of EMT by GSK-3β in Huh7.5M is regulated by p38MAPK and ERK1/2 that has not been reported elsewhere and is distinct from another metastatic non-hepatic cell line MDA-MB-231.

The AHR is a ligand-activated nuclear receptor that regulates genes involved in xenobiotic metabolism and T-cell differentiation. Here, we tested the hypothesis that AHR antagonism would also prevent obesity and fatty liver in female mice and that B6 mice (higher-affinity AHR) and congenic B6.D2 mice (lower-affinity AHR) would differentially respond to AHR inhibition. Female and male adult B6 and B6.D2 mice were fed control and Western diets with and without α-naphthoflavone (NF), an AHR inhibitor. A nonlinear mixed-model analysis was developed to project asymptote body mass. We found that obesity, adiposity, and liver steatosis were reduced to near control levels in all female and male B6 and B6.D2 experimental groups fed Western diet with NF. However, differences were noted in that female B6.D2 vs B6 mice on Western diet became more obese; and in general, female mice compared with male mice had a greater fat mass to body mass ratio, were less responsive to NF, and had reduced liver steatosis and hepatomegaly. We report that male mice fed Western diet containing NF or CH-223191, another AHR inhibitor, caused reduced mRNA levels of several liver genes involved in metabolism, including Cyp1b1 and Scd1, offering evidence for a possible mechanism by which the AHR regulates obesity. In conclusion, although there are some sex- and Ahr allelic-dependent differences, AHR inhibition prevents obesity and liver steatosis in both males and females regardless of the ligand-binding capacity of the AHR. We also present evidence consistent with the notion that an AHR-CYP1B1-SCD1 axis is involved in obesity, providing potentially convenient and effective targets for treatment.</abstracttext>]","[<div class=""keywords""><h4>KEYWORDS: </h4><p>AHR inhibition and obesity therapy; AHR-CYP1B1-SCD1 axis; Aryl hydrocarbon receptor; Hepatosteatosis; Male and female obesity</p></div>]",[],['https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0271-5317(16)30758-8']

Estimations of survival and risk of treatment-related deterioration in quality of life (QOL) are important when deciding on treatment. Although we know of several prognostic factors for LC patients with BMs, the role of QOL has not been established. Authors of this study set out to evaluate changes in QOL following Gamma Knife surgery (GKS) for BMs in LC patients and QOL as a prognostic factor for survival. METHODS Forty-four of 48 consecutive LC patients with BMs underwent GKS in the period from May 2010 to September 2011, and their QOL was prospectively assessed before and 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after GKS by using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Brain (FACT-BR) questionnaire. A mixed linear regression model was used to identify potential predictive factors for QOL and to assess the effect of GKS and the disease course on QOL at follow-up. RESULTS Mean QOL as measured by the brain cancer subscale (BRCS) of the FACT-BR remained stable from baseline (score 53.0) up to 12 months post-GKS (57.1; p = 0.624). The BRCS score improved for 32 patients (72.3%) with a total BM volume ≤ 5 cm<sup>3</sup>. Mean improvement in these patients was 0.45 points each month of follow-up, compared to a decline of 0.50 points each month despite GKS treatment in patients with BM volumes &gt; 5 cm<sup>3</sup> (p = 0.04). Asymptomatic BMs (p = 0.01), a lower recursive partitioning analysis (RPA) classification (p = 0.04), and a higher Karnofsky Performance Scale (KPS) score (p &lt; 0.01) at baseline were predictors for a high, stable QOL after GKS. After multivariate analysis, a high KPS score (p &lt; 0.01) remained the only positive predictor of a high, stable QOL post-GKS. Median survival post-GKS was 5.6 months (95% CI 1.0-10.3). A higher BRCS score (p = 0.01), higher KPS score (p = 0.01), female sex (p = 0.01), and the absence of liver (p = 0.02), adrenal (p = 0.02), and bone metastases (p = 0.03) predicted longer survival in unadjusted models. However, in multivariate analyses, a higher BRCS score (p &lt; 0.01), female sex (p = 0.01), and the absence of bone metastases (p = 0.02) at GKS remained significant predictors. Finally, the BRCS score's predictive value for survival was compared with the values for the variables behind well-known prognostic indices: age, KPS score, extracranial disease status, and number and volume of BMs. Both BRCS score (p = 0.01) and BM volume (p = 0.05) remained significant predictors for survival in the final model. CONCLUSIONS Patient-reported QOL according to the BRCS is a predictor of survival in patients with BMs and may be helpful in deciding on the optimal treatment. Gamma Knife surgery is a safe and effective therapeutic modality that improves QOL for LC patients with a BM volume ≤ 5 cm<sup>3</sup> at treatment.

The aim of our study was to assess extrahepatic metastatic pattern of different histological subtypes and evaluate prognostic effects of extrahepatic metastasis in patients with advanced disease. <b>Methods:</b> Based on the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) database, eligible patients diagnosed with primary liver cancer was identified between 2010 to 2012. We adopted Chi-square test to compared metastasis distribution among different histological types. We compared survival difference of patients with different extrahepatic metastasises by Kaplan-Meier analysis.

However, the exact relationship between the level of miR-1301 expression and HCC cell migration, invasion, and angiogenesis remains largely unknown. Quantitative PCR was used to evaluate the level of miR-1301 expression in HCC tissues and cell lines. Transwell and tube-formation assays were used to measure the effects of miR-1301 on HCC cell migration and invasion, and angiogenesis, respectively. Luciferase reporter assays and western blotting were used to confirm the miR-1301 target genes. We found that miR-1301 was significantly downregulated in HCC tissues and cell lines. Low miR-1301 expression was associated with tumor vascular invasion and Edmondson grade. Gain- and loss-of-function assays demonstrated that miR-1301 inhibited the migration, invasion, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and angiogenesis of HCC cells in vitro and in vivo. BCL9, upregulated in HCC tissues compared with matched adjacent normal tissues, was inversely correlated to miR-1301 levels in HCC tissues. Through reporter gene and western blot assays, BCL9 was shown to be a direct miR-1301 target. BCL9 overexpression could partially reverse the effects of miR-1301 on HCC cell migration and invasion. Most importantly, miR-1301 overexpression markedly suppressed the death of xenograft mouse models of cancer by reducing tumor load, metastasis, and host angiogenesis by downregulating BCL9, β-catenin, and vascular endothelial growth factor expression in tumor cells. Our observations suggested that miR-1301 inhibits HCC migration, invasion, and angiogenesis via decreasing Wnt/β-catenin signaling through targeting BCL9, and might be a therapeutic target for HCC.</abstracttext>]",[],[],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/cddis.2017.356']

However, due to the risk of transfusion related reaction, contamination, and immunological reaction, its use for tumor patients has been controversial and limited. To explore the feasibility of the application of IOCS in cancer patients, we reported 2 cases of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) with tumor embolism in IVC that underwent radical nephrectomy,and inferior caval venous thrombectomy receiving IOCS combined with leukocyte depletion filter (LDF) from August 2016 to November 2016 in our hospital. The cell saver blood salvage (Haemonetics, 5+) was used for these 2 cases. The salvaged blood was filtered through the LDF before infusion. For case 1 (male 45-year-old) the total operation time was 505 min, and the estimated blood loss was 4 500 ml. A total of 1 000 mL autologous blood, 12 u allogeneic packed red blood cells (PRBC), 1 200 mL fresh frozen plasma (FFP) were infused during the procedure. The patient was discharged from hospital after 75 days without complications. The postoperative follow-up for 3 months showed no tumor recurrence or metastasis.

Other relevant retrospective studies with this technique showed that cell salvage could be used safely in many kinds of cancer patients, for example, bladder cancer, liver cancer and kidney cancer. Furthermore,numerous researches have proved the safety and efficacy of the combination of these two techniques, the intraoperative cell salvage technique and leucocyte depletion filter in cancer patients.

However, few long-term longitudinal studies have examined trends in the incidence and prevalence of serious liver complications among women compared with men with HCV infection. We used the Veterans Administration Corporate Data Warehouse to identify all veterans with positive HCV viraemia from January 2000 to December 2013. We calculated gender-specific annual incidence and prevalence rates of cirrhosis, decompensated cirrhosis and hepatocellular cancer (HCC) adjusting for age, diabetes, HIV and alcohol use. We also calculated the average annual per cent change (AAPC) for each outcome by gender using piecewise linear regression in the Joinpoint software. We identified 264 409 HCV-infected veterans during 2000-2013, of whom 7162 (2.7%) were women. There were statistically significant increases over time in the incidence rates of cirrhosis, decompensated cirrhosis and HCC for both men and women. The annual-adjusted incidence rates of cirrhosis, decompensated cirrhosis and HCC were higher in men than women for all study years. However, these complications increased at a similar rate in both groups. Specifically, the AAPC for cirrhosis was 13.1 and 15.2, while it was 15.6 and 16.9 for decompensated cirrhosis and 21.0 and 25.3 for HCC in men and women, respectively (all test of parallelism not significant). The results were similar in the prevalence analyses, although AAPCs were slightly smaller for each outcome. In conclusion, we found an ongoing upward trend in the incidence and prevalence of HCV complications in this cohort of HCV-infected women. This increase in cirrhosis complications in women with active HCV infection is similar to those in men. With cure from HCV now becoming a reality, most of the projected burden of HCV is potentially preventable. However, benefits of HCV treatment will need to extend to all patients in order to stem the rising tide of HCV complications.</abstracttext>]","[<div class=""keywords""><h4>KEYWORDS: </h4><p>

Accordingly, this study was initiated to evaluate irradiated β-glucan as a modulator for cellular signaling growth factors involved in the pathogenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma in rats. Hepatocellular carcinoma was induced with 20 mg diethylnitrosamine/kg BW. Rats received daily by gastric gavage 65 mg irradiated β-glucan/kg BW. It was found that treatment of rats with diethylnitrosamine induced hepatic injury and caused significant increase in liver injury markers with a concomitant significant increase in both hepatic oxidative and inflammatory indices: alpha-fetoprotein, interferon gamma, and interleukin 6 in comparison with normal and irradiated β-glucan-treated groups. Western immunoblotting showed a significant increase in the signaling growth factors: extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and phosphoinositide 3-kinase proteins in a diethylnitrosamine-treated group while both preventive and therapeutic irradiated β-glucan treatments recorded significant improvement versus diethylnitrosamine group via the modulation of growth factors that encounters hepatic toxicity. The transcript levels of vascular endothelial growth factor A and inducible nitric oxide synthase genes were significantly higher in the diethylnitrosamine-treated group in comparison with controls. Preventive and therapeutic treatments with irradiated β-glucan demonstrated that the transcript level of these genes was significantly decreased which demonstrates the protective effect of β-glucan. Histological investigations revealed that diethylnitrosamine treatment affects the hepatic architecture throughout the significant severe appearance of inflammatory cell infiltration in the portal area and congestion in the portal vein in association with severe degeneration and dysplasia in hepatocytes all over hepatic parenchyma. The severity of hepatic architecture changes was significantly decreased with both β-glucan therapeutic and preventive treatments.

2017-09-03 16:07:24,"liver,cancer",20301551,Sickle Cell Disease.,Cancer biology &amp; therapy,Bender MA.,1993,"[<abstracttext label=""CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS"">Sickle cell disease (SCD) is characterized by intermittent vaso-occlusive events and chronic hemolytic anemia. Vaso-occlusive events result in tissue ischemia leading to acute and chronic pain as well as organ damage that can affect any organ system, including the bones, spleen, liver, brain, lungs, kidneys, and joints. Dactylitis (pain and/or swelling of the hands or feet) is often the earliest manifestation of SCD. In children, the spleen can become engorged with blood cells in a “splenic sequestration.” The spleen is particularly vulnerable to infarction and the majority of individuals with SCD who are not on hydroxyurea or transfusion therapy become functionally asplenic in early childhood, increasing their risk for certain types of bacterial infections. Acute chest syndrome is a major cause of mortality in SCD. Chronic hemolysis can result in varying degrees of anemia, jaundice, cholelithiasis, and delayed growth and sexual maturation. Individuals with the highest rates of hemolysis are predisposed to pulmonary artery hypertension, priapism, and leg ulcers but may be relatively protected from vaso-occlusive pain.</abstracttext>, <abstracttext label=""DIAGNOSIS/TESTING"">SCD encompasses a group of disorders characterized by the presence of at least one hemoglobin S allele (HbS; p.Glu6Val in <i>HBB</i>) and a second <i>HBB</i> pathogenic variant resulting in abnormal hemoglobin polymerization. Hb S/S (homozygous p.Glu6Val in <i>HBB)</i> accounts for 60%-70% of SCD in the United States. Other forms of SCD result from coinheritance of HbS with other abnormal β-globin chain variants, the most common forms being sickle-hemoglobin C disease (Hb S/C) and two types of sickle β-thalassemia (Hb S/β<sup>+</sup>-thalassemia and Hb S/β°-thalassemia); rarer forms result from coinheritance of other Hb variants such as D-Punjab, O-Arab, and E. The diagnosis of SCD is established by identification of significant quantities of HbS with or without an additional abnormal β-globin chain variant by hemoglobin assay or by identification of biallelic <i>HBB</i> pathogenic variants where at least one allele is the p.Glu6Val pathogenic variant (e.g., homozygous p.Glu6Val; p.Glu6Val and a second <i>HBB</i> pathogenic variant) on molecular genetic testing. All states in the US have included newborn screening for SCD since 2005. Newborn screening programs perform isoelectric focusing and/or high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) of an eluate of dried blood spots. A few newborn screening programs confirm results with molecular testing.</abstracttext>, <abstracttext label=""MANAGEMENT""><i>Treatment of manifestations:</i> Management of pain episodes includes hydration, anti-inflammatory agents, and pain medication. Pain episodes are additionally managed with a multi-model approach (e.g., warmth, massage, distraction, acupuncture, biofeedback, self-hypnosis). Fever and suspected infection is treated with appropriate antibiotics. Life-threatening or severe complications (e.g., severe acute chest syndrome, aplastic crisis, and stroke) are often treated with red blood cell transfusion. Splenectomy may be necessary for splenic sequestration. Severe priapism may require aspiration and irrigation. <i>Prevention of primary manifestations:</i> Maintain hydration and avoid climate extremes. Chronic red blood cell transfusion in children at risk for stroke and individuals with pulmonary hypertension, chronic renal failure, recurrent acute chest syndrome, and severe end-organ damage. Hydroxyurea can decrease the frequency and severity of vaso-occlusive processes, reduce transfusion needs, and increase life span. Glutamine has received FDA approval for the prevention of acute complications in individuals with SCD age five years and older. Stem cell transplantation may be an option in selected individuals. <i>Prevention of secondary complications:</i> Aggressive education on the management of fevers; prophylactic antibiotics, including penicillin in children; immunizations; folic acid supplementation; and iron chelation therapy for those with iron overload. <i>Surveillance:</i> Periodic comprehensive medical and social evaluation, mental health and neurocognitive assessment, and routine dental care. Annual CBC and reticulocyte count, assessment of iron status, liver and renal function tests, urinalysis, LDH, and vitamin D level. Annual transcranial Doppler to determine risk of stroke in all children with Hb S/S and Hb S/β°-thalassemia and ophthalmologic evaluation in all with sickling disorders. There should be a low threshold to evaluate for end-organ damage including chest x-ray, ECG, abdominal ultrasound, and iron overload. Due to the high frequency and severity of cardiopulmonary complications there should be a particularly low threshold to obtain an echocardiogram, pulmonary function tests, and sleep study in individuals of any age with cardiac or pulmonary concerns. <i>Agents/circumstances to avoid:</i> Dehydration, extremes of temperature, physical exhaustion, extremely high altitude, recreational drugs with vasoconstrictive or cardiac stimulation effects, and meperidine. <i>Evaluation of relatives at risk:</i> Early diagnosis of at-risk family members allows education and intervention before symptoms or end-organ damage are present. <i>Pregnancy management:</i> Women with SCD who become pregnant require close follow up and monitoring by a hematologist and obstetrician; an increased risk for preterm labor, thrombosis, infectious complications, and acute painful episodes has been reported during pregnancy; hydroxyurea should be discontinued during pregnancy.</abstracttext>, <abstracttext label=""GENETIC COUNSELING"">SCD is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. If one parent is a carrier of the <i>HBB</i> HbS pathogenic variant and the other is a carrier of any of the <i>HBB</i> pathogenic variants (e.g., HbS, HbC, β-thalassemia), each child has a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being unaffected and a carrier, and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier. Carrier detection for common forms of SCD is most commonly accomplished by isoelectric focusing or HPLC. Prenatal diagnosis for pregnancies at increased risk for SCD is possible by molecular genetic testing if the <i>HBB</i> pathogenic variants have been identified in the parents.</abstracttext>]",[],[],"['/books/NBK1377/""><img src=""/corehtml/pmc/pmcgifs/bookshelf/thumbs/th-gene.png"" alt=""Click here to read"" /></a></div><div class=""v_align_center""><a class=""book_title_link""']"

The sex-specific difference was associated with distinct transcriptional patterns in metabolism-related organs, showing altered hepatic glycolysis and decreased adipose Glucose transporter 4 (Glut4) in males and increased gluconeogenesis and lipid-synthesis in females. Furthermore, the changes in females were linked to hepatic ER stress, leading to suppressed insulin signaling and non-obese hyperglycemic phenotypes.

Plasmid DNA encoding for each trap was formulated in nanoparticles and intravenously injected to mice bearing orthotopic pancreatic cancer. Expression of traps was mainly seen in the tumor, and secondarily, accumulations were primarily in the liver. Combination trap therapy shrunk the tumor and significantly prolonged the host survival. Either trap alone only brought in a partial therapeutic effect. We also found that CXCL12 trap allowed T-cell penetration into the tumor, and PD-L1 trap allowed the infiltrated T-cells to kill the tumor cells.

Here we explore the role of KLF6 in acute liver injury models in mice, and in patients with acute liver failure (ALF). KLF6 was induced in hepatocytes in ALF, and in both acetaminophen (APAP)- and carbon tetrachloride (CCl<sub>4</sub>)-treated mice. In mice with hepatocyte-specific Klf6 knockout (DeltaKlf6), cell proliferation following partial hepatectomy (PHx) was increased compared to controls. Interestingly, key autophagic markers and mediators LC3-II, Atg7 and Beclin1 were reduced in DeltaKlf6 mice livers. Using luciferase assay and ChIP, KLF6 was established as a direct transcriptional activator of ATG7 and BECLIN1, but was dependent on the presence of p53. Here we show, that KLF6 expression is induced in ALF and in the regenerating liver, where it activates autophagy by transcriptional induction of ATG7 and BECLIN1 in a p53-dependent manner.

Small intestinal mucosal damage can trigger postoperative complications via various pathways. Therefore, we investigated the efficacy of intermittent portal venous clamping, which we named congestive preconditioning (CPC), for decreasing congestive re-outflow injury (CRoI) of the small intestine. MATERIAL AND METHODS Small intestinal CRoI was induced in rats by clamping the portal vein (PV) for 30 min, followed by re-outflow. The CPC group underwent 3 episodes of 5 min PV clamping and 5 min re-outflow before CRoI. The Control group underwent CRoI after 30 min simple laparotomy without any preconditioning. Survival and histological changes in the small intestine after CRoI were analyzed. The histological changes were compared CPC group to Control group using a scoring system that expressed histopathological severity. Also, small intestinal apoptosis and expression of apoptosis-related genes were analyzed by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS The survival rate of the CPC group was significantly higher than Control group. Histological scoring of small intestinal damage was significantly lower in the CPC group after 6 h of CRoI. Expression of anti-apoptotic gene, Bcl-xL was significantly increased, but pro-apoptotic gene caspase-3 and apoptotic cells did not differ significantly between the CPC group and Control group.

Oxidative stress is a known consequence of ethanol metabolism and is thought to contribute significantly to alcoholic liver disease (ALD). Therefore, elucidating pathways leading to sustained oxidative stress and downstream redox imbalances may reveal how ethanol consumption leads to ALD. Recent studies suggest that ethanol metabolism impacts mitochondrial antioxidant processes through a number of proteomic alterations, including hyperacetylation of key antioxidant proteins.</abstracttext>, <abstracttext label=""METHODS"" nlmcategory=""METHODS"">In order to elucidate mechanisms of ethanol-induced hepatic oxidative stress, we investigate a role for protein hyperacetylation in modulating mitochondrial superoxide dismutase (SOD2) structure and function in a 6-week Lieber-DeCarli murine model of ethanol consumption. Our experimental approach includes immunoblotting, immunohistochemistry, activity assays, mass spectrometry, and in silico modeling.</abstracttext>, <abstracttext label=""RESULTS"" nlmcategory=""RESULTS"">We found that ethanol metabolism significantly increased the acetylation of SOD2 at two functionally relevant lysine sites, K68 and K122, resulting in a 40% decrease in enzyme activity while overall SOD2 abundance was unchanged. In vitro studies also reveal which lysine residues are more susceptible to acetylation. Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrates that SOD2 hyperacetylation occurs near zone 3 within the liver, which is the main ethanol-metabolizing region of the liver.</abstracttext>, <abstracttext label=""CONCLUSION"" nlmcategory=""CONCLUSIONS"">Overall, the findings presented in this study support a role for ethanol-induced lysine acetylation as an adverse post-translational modification within the mitochondria that directly impacts SOD2 charge-state and activity.

Several techniques and devices have been introduced in liver surgery in order to minimize intraoperative haemorrhage during parenchymal transection. Radiofrequency (RF)-assisted liver resection has been shown to be an effective method to minimize bleeding in open and laparoscopic liver resection. A number of RF devices for parenchymal transection have been designed to assist laparoscopic liver resections. Here we have reviewed the results of various RF devices in laparoscopic liver resection. A total 15 article were considered relevant for the evaluation of technical aspects and outcomes of RF-assisted liver resections in laparoscopic procedures. In these studies, 176 patients had laparoscopic liver resection using RF-assisted parenchymal coagulation. Two monopolar and three bipolar devices were employed. Blood loss was limited in most of the studies. The need of blood transfusions was limited to two cases in all the series. Conversion was necessary due to bleeding in 3 cases. Operative and transection times varied between studies. However, RF-assisted resection with bipolar devices appeared to have taken less time in comparison to other RF devices. RF-related complications were minimum, and only one case of in-hospital death due to hepatic failure was reported. Although RF has been used in a small minority of laparoscopic liver resections, laparoscopic RF-assisted liver resection for benign and malignant disease is a safe and feasible procedure associated with reduction in blood loss, low morbidity, and lower hospital mortality rates.</abstracttext>]","[<div class=""keywords""><h4>KEYWORDS: </h4><p>Laparoscopic; Liver resection; Radiofrequency-assisted</p></div>]",[],['https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0960-7404(17)30120-2']

An internal cooled radiofrequency electrode was described to achieve tissue coagulation to a greater margin width. The aim of this study is to determinate if a RF-assisted transection device (RFAT) has any effect on local hepatic recurrence (LHER) compared to conventional technologies. A study population of 103 patients who had undergone a hepatic surgical resection was retrospectively analysed. Patients were classified into two groups according to the device used: a RF-assisted device (RFAT group; n = 45) and standard conventional devices (control group; n = 58). LHER was defined as any growing or enhancing tumour in the margin of hepatic resection during follow-up. Cox proportional models were constructed and variables were eliminated only if p &gt; 0.20 to protect against residual confounding. To assess the stability of Cox's regression model and its internal validity, a bootstrap investigation was also performed. Baseline and operative characteristics were similar in both groups. With a mean follow-up of 28.5 months (range 2-106), in patients with positive margins, we demonstrated 0% of LHER in RFAT vs. 27% in control group (p = 0.032). In the multivariate analysis five factors demonstrated significant influence on the final model of LHER: RFAT group, size of the largest metastases, number of resected metastases, positive margin and usage of Pringle-manoeuvre.

Rarely, colonic involvement is seen and it is generally due to direct extension to the rectum. It is exceedingly uncommon for distant metastasis to occur in the right colon and small bowel. We present a case of prostatic adenocarcinoma metastasizing to the appendiceal orifice in a 78-year-old male. Our patient had a history of adenocarcinoma of the prostate diagnosed four years prior to presentation. He also had a history of adenocarcinoma of the distal colon 30 years prior which resulted in a partial colectomy and permanent diverting colostomy. Prior to his presentation, follow-up colonoscopies failed to reveal disease progression or additional malignancy. During routine colonoscopy, he was found to have a 2.5 cm polyp near the appendiceal orifice. Histologically the polyp demonstrated colonic mucosa with an infiltration of the lamina propria by individual cells with abundant cytoplasm and round nuclei with prominent nucleoli. The neoplastic cells were strongly positive for PSA and negative for CK7, CK20, and CDX2 supporting a diagnosis of metastatic prostatic adenocarcinoma. Metastatic disease of extracolonic origin arising in a polyp is extremely uncommon, but metastases have been reported to involve breast, ovary, stomach, esophagus, and kidney. This case contributes to the scarce information available regarding metastatic spread of prostate cancer to the ascending colon and enlightens the community of pathologists, surgeons, gastroenterologists, and urologists about this unusual presentation of a common carcinoma.</abstracttext>]",[],[],[]

This study determined the protective role of aqueous extract from Nelumbo nucifera leaves (NLE) against N-diethylnitrosamine (DEN)-induced oxidative stress and hepatocellular carcinogenesis in a sample of Sprague-Dawley rats. NLE was fed orally to rats in which hepatic carcinoma was induced with DEN for 12 weeks. Five groups of 12 rats each were used for the study: Group I (control group) rats received distilled water; Group II rats were induced with DEN; Group III rats were induced with DEN and cotreated with 0.5% NLE; Group IV rats were induced with DEN and cotreated with 1.0% NLE; and Group V rats were induced with DEN and cotreated with 2.0% NLE. Clinical chemistry, organ weight, inflammatory marker, protein expression, enzyme, and antioxidant analyses were conducted. NLE administration to rats resulted in significantly decreased levels of serum alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and albumin, which is indicative of hepatocellular damage, compared with the control group. DEN-induced oxidative stress was inhibited by NLE and this inhibition was paralleled by decreased lipid peroxides and increased glutathione transferase, superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase activity in liver tissues. The status of nonenzymatic antioxidants, such as reduced glutathione, was also found to be increased in NLE-administered rats. Furthermore, NLE decreased tumor size, hepatic Rac1, PKCα, and GSTπ expressions compared with the DEN-only group. Thus, supplementation of NLE reduced the adverse changes that occur because of liver cancer. These results prove that NLE protects against liver carcinogenesis induced because of treatment with DEN through blocking lipid peroxidation, hepatic cell damage, and enhancing the antioxidant defense system.</abstracttext>]","[<div class=""keywords""><h4>KEYWORDS: </h4><p>Nelumbo nucifera leaves; Rac1; diethylnitrosamine; hepatocellular carcinoma; oxidative stress</p></div>]",[],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/tox.22434']

The target compound SiPc-biotin showed much higher binding affinity toward BR-positive (biotin receptor overexpressed) HeLa human cervical carcinoma cells than its precursor SiPc-pip. However, when the biotin receptors of HeLa cells were blocked by free biotin, &gt;50% uptake of SiPc-biotin was suppressed, demonstrating that SiPc-biotin could selectively accumulate in BR-positive cancer cells via the BR-mediated internalization. The confocal fluorescence images further confirmed the target binding ability of SiPc-biotin. As a consequence of specificity of SiPc-biotin toward BR-positive HeLa cells, the photodynamic effect was also largely dependent on the BR expression level of HeLa cells. The photodynamic activities of SiPc-biotin against HeLa cells were dramatically reduced when the biotin receptors were blocked by the free biotin (IC<sub>50</sub>: 0.18μM vs. 0.46μM). It is concluded that SiPc-biotin can selectively damage BR-positive cancer cells under irradiation. Furthermore, the dark toxicity of SiPc-biotin toward human normal liver cell lines LO2 was much lower than that of its precursor SiPc-pip. The targeting photodynamic activity and low dark toxicity suggest that SiPc-biotin is a promising photosensitizer for tumor-targeting photodynamic therapy.</abstracttext>]","[<div class=""keywords""><h4>KEYWORDS: </h4><p>Biotin; Photodynamic therapy; Photosensitizer; Silicon(IV) phthalocyanine</p></div>]",[],['https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1011-1344(17)30563-8']

One of these circadian genes, NPAS2, encodes for a member of the bHLH-PAS class of transcription factors and is expressed in the forebrain and in some peripheral organs such as liver and skin. Other biological processes are also regulated by circadian genes. For example, NPAS2 is involved in cell proliferation, DNA damage repair and malignant transformation. Aberrant expression of clock genes has been previously observed in melanoma which led to our effort to sequence the NPAS2 promoter region in this cancer type. The NPAS2 putative promoter and 5' untranslated region of ninety-three melanoma patients and ninety-six control subjects were sequenced and several variants were identified. Among these is a novel microsatellite comprising a GGC repeat with different alleles ranging from 7 to 13 repeats located in the 5' untranslated exon.

In addition to its orthodox nutrient substrates, AQP9 also transports multiple neutral and ionic arsenic species including arsenic trioxide, monomethylarsenous acid (MAs<sup>III</sup>) and dimethylarsenic acid (DMA<sup>V</sup>). Here we discovered a new group of AQP9 substrates which includes two clinical relevant selenium species. We showed that AQP9 efficiently transports monomethylselenic acid (MSeA) with a preference for acidic pH, which has been demonstrated in Xenopus laevis oocyte following the overexpression of human AQP9. Specific inhibitors that dissipate transmembrane proton potential or change the transmembrane pH gradient, such as FCCP, valinomycin and nigericin did not significantly inhibit MSeA uptake, suggesting MSeA transport is not proton coupled. AQP9 was also found to transport ionic selenite and lactate, with much less efficiency compared with MSeA uptake. Selenite and lactate uptake via AQP9 is pH dependent and inhibited by FCCP and nigericin, but not valinomycin. The selenite and lactate uptake via AQP9 can be inhibited by different lactate analogs, indicating that their translocation share similar mechanisms. AQP9 transport of MSeA, selenite and lactate is all inhibited by a previously identified AQP9 inhibitor, phloretin, and the AQP9 substrate arsenite (As<sup>III</sup>).

In addition, whether MAIT cell functions can be impacted by chemotherapy is unclear. These are important questions given MAIT cells' potent immunomodulatory and inflammatory properties. Herein, we examined the frequencies and functions of peripheral blood, healthy liver tissue, tumor-margin and tumor-infiltrating MAIT cells in 21 CRLM patients who received no chemotherapy, FOLFOX, or a combination of FOLFOX and Avastin before they underwent liver resection.

Accordingly, unlike those residing in the healthy liver compartment, tumor-infiltrating MAIT cells failed to produce IFN-γ in response to a panel of TCR and cytokine receptor ligands, and tumor-margin MAIT cells were only partially active. Furthermore, chemotherapy did not account for intratumoral MAIT cell insufficiencies. Our findings demonstrate for the first time that CRLM-penetrating MAIT cells exhibit wide-ranging functional impairments, which are dictated by their physical location but not by preoperative chemotherapy.

To do this safely, this may require multiple layers of cancer specificity. The pharmacology and specificity of oncolytic adenoviruses can be modified by (1) physical retargeting, (2) physical detargeting, (3) chemical shielding, or (4) by modifying the ability of viral early gene products to selectively activate in cancer versus normal cells. We explored the utility of these approaches with oncolytic adenovirus serotype 5 (Ad5) in immunocompetent Syrian hamsters bearing subcutaneous HaK tumors.

Next, the deregulation of let-7 was confirmed by quantitative real-time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) in another set of liver tissues, including normal control (NC), chronic hepatitis (CH), liver cirrhosis (LC), HCC, and adjacent nontumor (NT) tissues. In addition, as the potential target mRNA of let-7, alpha 2(I) collagen (COL1A2) mRNA was also quantified in the above liver tissues. Finally, an association study comparing let-7 and COL1A2 and their clinical significance in HCC was conducted.PCR array analysis revealed that the expression levels of let-7a/7b/7c were significantly downregulated in early-stage HCC compared to those in NT tissues. As compared to NC samples, qRT-PCR further confirmed that let-7a/7b/7c/7e were significantly upregulated in CH, LC, and NT tissues, while there were no significant differences in expression between the HCC and NC groups. Although COL1A2 may be the target mRNA of let-7, only let-7c expression was inversely correlated with COL1A2 mRNA expression in CH tissues. In HCC tissues, levels of let-7a/7b/7c/7e were positively correlated with that of COL1A2 mRNA. The clinical significance study revealed that elevated let-7a expression was significantly correlated with serosal and vein invasion, while elevated let-7c expression was significantly correlated with vein invasion and advanced TNM stage. Elevated let-7e expression was significantly correlated with vein invasion in HCC. Significantly shorter postoperative overall survival was observed in HCC patients with high let-7c expression.The results suggest that aberrant expression of let-7a/7b/7c/7e occurs in benign liver diseases and HCC.

Res-006 was more effectively suppressed the viability of HepG2 human hepatoma cells than resveratrol (the IC<sub>50</sub> values were 67.2 and 354.8 μmol/L, respectively). Co-treatment with the ER stress regulator 4-phenylbutyrate (0.5 mmol/L) or the ROS inhibitor N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC, 1 mmol/L) significantly attenuated Res-006-induced HepG2 cell death, suggesting that pro-apoptotic ER stress and/or ROS may govern the Res-006-induced HepG2 cell death. We further revealed that treatment of HepG2 cells with Res-006 (65 μmol/L) immediately elicited the dysregulation of mitochondrial dynamics and the accumulation of mitochondrial ROS. It also collapsed the mitochondrial membrane potential and further induced ER stress and cell death. These events, except for the change in mitochondrial morphology, were prevented by the exposure of the HepG2 cells to the mitochondrial ROS scavenger, Mito-TEMPO (300-1000 μmol/L). The results suggest that Res-006 may kill HepG2 cells through cell death pathways, including the ER stress initiated by mitochondrial ROS accumulation.

The effects of PCDH9 re‑expression and knockdown on growth, proliferation and tumorigenic potential were determined.

It is also an important protein for tumor growth, survival, and cancer cell metastasis. In our previous study, we have shown that hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection induces epithelial-mesenchymal transition state (EMT) and cancer stem-like cell (CSC) properties in human hepatocytes. Our array data suggested that endoglin (CD105) mRNA is significantly upregulated in HCV associated CSCs. In this study, we have observed increased endoglin expression on the cell surface of HCV core expressing hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2) cell line or immortalized human hepatocytes (IHH) and activation of its downstream signaling molecules. The status of phospho-SMAD1/5 and the expression of inhibitor of DNA binding protein 1 (ID1) were upregulated in HCV infected cells or viral core gene transfected cells. Additionally, we observed upregulation of endoglin/ID1 mRNA expression in chronic HCV patient liver biopsy samples. CSC generation by HCV core protein was dependent on the endoglin signaling pathway using activin receptor-like kinase (ALK)-1 Fc blocking peptide and endoglin siRNA. Further, follow-up from <i>in vitro</i> analysis suggested that anti-apoptosis Bcl2 protein, proliferation related Cyclin D1 protein, and CSC associated Hes1, Notch1, Nanog and Sox2 proteins are enhanced during infection or ectopic expression of HCV core protein.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> Endoglin plays a crucial role in fibrogenesis and angiogenesis, and is an important protein for tumor growth, survival, and cancer cell metastasis. Endoglin enhances ALK1/SMAD1/5 signaling in different cell types, leading to increased proliferation and migration responses.

Due to its extremely high sequence variability, HCV can readily escape the immune response, thus an effective vaccine must target conserved, functionally important epitopes. Using the structure of a broadly neutralizing antibody in complex with a conserved linear epitope from the HCV E2 envelope glycoprotein (residues 412-423; epitope I), we performed structure-based design of immunogens to induce antibody responses to this epitope. This resulted in epitope-based immunogens based on a cyclic defensin protein, as well as a bivalent immunogen with two copies of the epitope on the E2 surface. We solved the x-ray structure of a cyclic immunogen in complex with the HCV1 antibody and confirmed preservation of the epitope conformation and the HCV1 interface. Mice vaccinated with our designed immunogens produced robust antibody responses to epitope I, and their serum could neutralize HCV. Notably, the cyclic designs induced greater epitope-specific responses and neutralization than the native peptide epitope. Beyond successfully designing several novel HCV immunogens, this study demonstrates the principle that neutralizing anti-HCV antibodies can be induced by epitope-based, engineered vaccines and provides the basis for further efforts in structure-based design of HCV vaccines.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> Hepatitis C virus is a leading cause of liver disease and liver cancer, with approximately 3% of the world's population infected. To combat this virus, an effective vaccine would have distinct advantages over current therapeutic options, yet experimental vaccines have not been successful to date, due in part to the virus's high sequence variability leading to immune escape. In this study we rationally designed several vaccine immunogens based on the structure of a conserved epitope that is the target of broadly neutralizing antibodies. In vivo results in mice indicated that these antigens elicited epitope-specific neutralizing antibodies, with varying degrees of potency and breadth. These promising results suggest that a rational design approach can be used to generate an effective vaccine for this virus.</abstracttext>]",[],[],['http://jvi.asm.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=28794021']

However, the importance of NOR1 in liver fibrosis remains to be elucidated. The present study aimed to investigate the effect of NOR1 on the proliferation and matrix expression of human hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) in vitro. Additionally, the molecular mechanisms underlying the role of NOR1 in the activation of HSCs was investigated. The present study determined that transforming growth factor β1 (TGF‑β1) may induce NOR1 expression in HSCs in a dose‑dependent manner, as determined by reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blot analysis. NOR1‑small hairpin (sh)RNA was transfected into TGF‑β1‑treated HSCs to knock down NOR1. The MTT assay revealed that TGF‑β1‑induced cell proliferation was significantly inhibited in the NOR1‑shRNA group. In addition, NOR1 knockdown significantly inhibited TGF‑β1‑induced protein expression of fibrosis indexes, including collagen 1, 3 and α‑smooth muscle actin (α‑SMA). Subsequently, NOR1‑pcDNA3.1 was transfected into HSCs to overexpress NOR1. It was revealed that NOR1 overexpression may activate the Wnt/β‑catenin pathway in HSCs. The gain‑of function experiments demonstrated that NOR1 overexpression promoted cell proliferation and the expression of fibrosis indexes; however, these effects may be attenuated by dickkopf‑1, an inhibitor of the Wnt/β‑catenin signaling pathway. In conclusion, the present study demonstrated that NOR1 activates HSCs and contributes to liver fibrosis in vitro and this effect was achieved through the activation of the Wnt/β‑catenin pathway. Therefore, the current study may provide a novel target for the treatment of chronic liver diseases.</abstracttext>]",[],[],['http://www.spandidos-publications.com/10.3892/mmr.2017.7165']

However, the association between PRL-3 and glycolysis in colorectal cancer cells is not well understood. In the present study, we explored the association between PRL-3 and glycolysis. We found that PRL-3 improved colorectal cancer cell glucose assumption, lactate production and reduced intracellular ROS levels. Besides, PRL-3 improved the expression of Glut1, HK2, PKM2 and LDHA, which are important glycolysis related molecules and enzymes. Moreover, we explored IL-8 mediated enhancement of glycolysis by PRL-3. More importantly, the proliferation and invasion of colorectal cancer cells were enhanced significantly by PRL-3 through improving glycolysis. Taken together, these results implicated the important role of PRL-3 in glycolysis metabolism through improving IL-8 secretion in colorectal cancer cells, and PRL-3 mediated glycolysis contributed to the promotion of cancer metastasis.</abstracttext>]",[],[],['http://www.spandidos-publications.com/10.3892/ijo.2017.4090']

We downloaded the gene expression profiles GSE18155 from GEO database and obtained the differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Then, we performed Gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway (KEGG) enrichment analyses via DAVID. In total, 3,502 DEGs were identified, including 1,563 upregulated genes and 1,939 downregulated genes. The top 10 hub genes, Ubc, Ubb, Mapk8, Ar, Pten, Cdk2, Cdk4, Rac1, Top2a and Cdkn1a were identified from the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network which was constructed by Cytoscape.

We then loaded doxorubicin into this promising system, designated as DHTPAuNCs consisting of hyaluronic acid-grafted and A54 peptide-targeted PEGylated AuNCs. Its formation was corroborated by ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy and dynamic light scattering. This delivery platform needed hyaluronidase to release encapsulated drugs, meanwhile the acidic pH and near-infrared irradiation could accelerate the release. In addition, the results of cellular uptake demonstrate that this system could bind specifically with BEL-7402 cells. In vitro, we evaluated therapeutic effects of the DHTPAuNCs in BEL-7402 cells by 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyl-tetrazolium bromide assay.

Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling, which is critical for innate immunity, is generally believed to aggravate disease progression by inducing inflammation. Unexpectedly, we found that deficiency in TIR domain-containing adaptor-inducing interferon-β (TRIF), a cytosolic adaptor that transduces some TLR signals, worsened hepatic steatosis induced by a high-fat diet (HFD) and that such exacerbation was independent of myeloid cells. The aggravated steatosis in <i>Trif</i><sup><i>-/-</i></sup> mice was due to the increased hepatocyte transcription of the gene encoding stearoyl-coenzyme A (CoA) desaturase 1 (SCD1), the rate-limiting enzyme for lipogenesis.

For this purpose, an amine-functional gold ion complex (GIC), [Au(III)(diethylenetriamine)Cl]Cl<sub>2</sub>, which generates heat upon RF exposure, was conjugated to carboxyl-functional poly(acrylic acid)-capped iron-oxide nanoparticles (IO-PAA NPs) to form IO-GIC NPs of size ∼100 nm. The multimodal superparamagnetic IO-GIC NPs produced T2-contrast on MR imaging and unlike IO-PAA NPs generated heat on RF exposure. The RF heating response of IO-GIC NPs was found to be dependent on the RF power, exposure period, and particle concentration. IO-GIC NPs at a concentration of 2.5 mg/mL showed a high heating response (δT) of ∼40 °C when exposed to 100 W RF power for 1 min. In vitro cytotoxicity measurements on NIH-3T3 fibroblast cells and 4T1 cancer cells showed that IO-GIC NPs are cytocompatible at high NP concentrations for up to 72 h. Upon in vitro RF exposure (100 W, 1 min), a high thermal response leads to cell death of 4T1 cancer cells incubated with IO-GIC NPs (1 mg/mL). Hematoxylin and eosin imaging of rat liver tissues injected with 100 μL of 2.5 mg/mL IO-GIC NPs and exposed to low RF power of 20 W for 10 min showed significant loss of tissue morphology at the site of injection, as against RF-exposed or nanoparticle-injected controls. In vivo MR imaging and noninvasive RF exposure of 4T1-tumor-bearing mice after IO-GIC NP administration showed T2 contrast enhancement and a localized generation of high temperatures in tumors, leading to tumor tissue damage.

Similarly, the expression level of RSPO2 was higher in HepG2, Huh7 and Hep3B cells but lower in Bel7404 and QGY7703 cells compared with human normal QSG7701 liver cells. Subsequently, gain-of-function studies indicated that RSPO2 promotes the proliferation and migration of QGY7703 cells based on lentivirus-based gene delivery. Furthermore, it was revealed that p21 and leptin, rather than vascular endothelial growth factor-A, are involved in the function of RSPO2 in QGY7703 cells.

It plays a role in mouse ES cell survival and is constitutively active without any mutations. It was also found to be responsible for the maintenance of quiescence of the hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), liver-resident mesenchymal stem cells, the activation of which results in liver fibrosis. This gene was not present in human ES cells. ERas was found to be activated in a significant population of human gastric cancer, where ERAS may play a crucial role in gastric cancer cell survival and metastases to liver via down-regulation of E-cadherin. ERas gene has been found to be expressed both in ES cells and adult tissues of cynomolgus monkey. Cynomolgus ERAS did not promote cell proliferation or induce tumor formation. ERAS was also detected in normal and neoplastic urothelium of the urinary bladder in cattle, where bovine ERAS formed a constitutive complex with platelet derived growth factor β receptor (PDGFβR) resulting in the activation of AKT signaling. Here, molecular and morphological findings of ERAS in the full term placenta of pregnant cows have been investigated for the first time. ERAS was studied by reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR). Alignment of the sequence detects a 100% identity with all transcript variant bovine ERas mRNAs, present in the GenBank database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). Furthermore, ERAS was detected by Western blot and investigated by real time PCR that revealed an amount of ERAS more than ERAS found in normal bovine urothelium but less than ERAS present in the liver. Immunohistochemical examination revealed the presence of ERAS protein both at the level of plasma membrane and in cytoplasm of epithelial cells lining caruncular crypts and in trophoblasts of villi. An evident ERAS immunoreactivity was also seen throughout the chorionic and uterine gland epithelium. Although this is not a functional study and further investigations will be warranted, it is conceivable that ERAS may have pleiotropic effects in the placenta, some of which, like normal urothelial cells, might lead to activation of AKT pathway. We speculate that ERAS may play a key role in cellular processes such as cell differentiation and movement. Accordingly, we believe it may be an important factor involved in trophoblast invasiveness via AKT signaling pathway. Therefore, ERas gene is a functional gene which contributes to homeostasis of bovine placenta.</abstracttext>]","[<div class=""keywords""><h4>KEYWORDS: </h4><p>Cow; ERas; Immunohistochemistry; PDGFβR; Placenta; Sequencing; Western blot</p></div>]",[],['https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0093-691X(17)30379-5']

However, there remains a dearth of data regarding molecular profiles that are shared across tissues, an understanding of which could lead to the development of highly versatile, broadly applicable therapies. Using data acquired from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), we performed a transcriptomics-centered analysis on 1494 patient samples, comparing the two major histological subtypes of solid tumors (adenocarcinomas and squamous cell carcinomas) across organs, with a focus on tissues in which both subtypes arise: esophagus, lung, and uterine cervix. Via principal component and hierarchical clustering analysis, we discovered that histology-driven differences accounted for a greater degree of inherent molecular variation in the tumors than did tissue of origin. We then analyzed differential gene expression, DNA methylation, and non-coding RNA expression between adenocarcinomas and squamous cell carcinomas and found 1733 genes, 346 CpG sites, and 42 microRNAs in common between organ sites, indicating specific adenocarcinoma-associated and squamous cell carcinoma-associated molecular patterns that were conserved across tissues. We then identified specific pathways that may be critical to the development of adenocarcinomas and squamous cell carcinomas, including Liver X receptor activation, which was upregulated in adenocarcinomas but downregulated in squamous cell carcinomas, possibly indicating important differences in cancer cell metabolism between these two histological subtypes of cancer. In addition, we highlighted genes that may be common drivers of adenocarcinomas specifically, such as IGF2BP1, which suggests a possible link between embryonic development and tumor subtype. Altogether, we demonstrate the need to consider biological similarities that transcend anatomical boundaries to inform the development of novel therapeutic strategies.

This study employs a novel motion simulation technique to determine if VMAT liver SBRT plans with an increase in MLC leaf modulation are more susceptible to dosimetric differences in the GTV due to interplay effects. For ten liver SBRT patients, two VMAT plans with different amounts of MLC leaf modulation were created. Motion was simulated using a random starting point in the respiratory cycle for each fraction. To isolate the interplay effect, motion was also simulated using four specific starting points in the respiratory cycle. The dosimetric differences caused by different starting points were examined by subtracting resultant dose distributions from each other. When motion was simulated using random starting points for each fraction, or with specific starting points, there were significantly more dose differences in the GTV (maximum 100cGy) for more highly modulated plans, but the overall plan quality was not adversely affected.

The present study investigated crosstalks between HCV infection and UNC5A, a netrin-1 dependence receptor that is inactivated in cancer. UNC5A and HCV parameters were monitored in patients samples (n=550) as well as in in vitro. In patients, UNC5A mRNA expression is significantly decreased in clinical HCV(+) specimens irrespective of the viral genotype, but not in (HBV)(+) liver biopsies, as compared to uninfected samples. UNC5A mRNA is downregulated in F2 (3-fold; P=0.009), in F3 (10-fold, P=0.0004) and more dramatically so in F4/cirrhosis (44-fold; P&lt;0.0001) histological stages of HCV(+) hepatic lesions compared to histologically matched HCV(-) tissues. UNC5A transcript was found strongly downregulated in HCC samples (33-fold; P&lt;0.0001) as compared with non-HCC samples. In vivo, association of UNC5A transcripts with polyribosomes is decreased by 50% in HCV(+) livers. Consistent results were obtained in vitro showing HCV-dependent depletion of UNC5A in HCV-infected hepatocyte-like cells and in primary human hepatocytes. Using luciferase reporter constructs, HCV cumulatively decreased UNC5A transcription from the UNC5 promoter and translation in a UNC5A 5'UTR-dependent manner. Proximity ligation assays, kinase assays, as well as knockdown and forced expression experiments identified UNC5A as capable of impeding autophagy and promoting HCV restriction through specific impact on virion infectivity, in a cell death-independent and DAPK-related manner. In conclusion, while the UNC5A dependence receptor counteracts HCV persistence through regulation of autophagy in a DAPK-dependent manner, it is dramatically decreased in all instances in HCC samples, and specifically by HCV in cirrhosis. Such data argue for the evaluation of the implication of UNC5A in liver carcinogenesis.Oncogene advance online publication, 7 August 2017; doi:10.1038/onc.2017.271.</abstracttext>]",[],[],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/onc.2017.271']

Liver cancer stem cells (CSCs) are believed to initiate hepatocarcinogenesis. To investigate the precise mechanism related to the origin of CSCs in liver cirrhosis and hepatocarcinogenesis, we labeled Axin2+ hepatic cells with EGFP in Axin2Cre;Rosa26EGFP transgenic rats, and then stratified clinical and rat liver cirrhosis samples by autophagy flux. Clinical follow-up and lineage tracing in transgenic rat liver cirrhosis revealed that while Axin2/EGFP+ hepatic cells were present in normal livers and cirrhotic livers without aberrant autophagy, hepatic Axin2/EGFP+CD90+ cells were generated exclusively in cirrhotic livers with aberrant autophagy and promoted hepatocarcinogenesis. Aberrant autophagy in liver cirrhosis resulted in hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) expression, leading to activation of Met/JNK and Met/STAT3 signaling in sorted hepatic Axin2/EGFP+ cells and their transition into Axin2/EGFP+CD90+ cells that possess CSC properties. In a transgenic rat liver cirrhosis model, induction or inhibition of autophagy in cirrhotic livers by systemic administration of rapamycin or chloroquine or transfection with Atg3- and Atg7-shRNAs significantly induced or suppressed HGF expression, which in turn increased or reduced generation of EGFP+CD90+ hepatic cells by activating or inactivating Met/JNK and Met/STAT3 signaling, thereby promoting or preventing hepatocarcinogenesis. Systemic treatment with HGF-shRNA, SP600125 or stattic also reduced generation of EGFP(Axin2)+ hepatic cell-originated CD90+ CSCs in aberrant autophagic cirrhotic livers by inactivating HGF/Met/JNK or HGF/Met/STAT3 signaling, further preventing hepatocarcinogenesis. These data suggest that activation of Met/JNK and Met/STAT3 signaling in Axin2+ hepatic cells via autophagy-dependent HGF expression and the resultant generation of Axin2+CD90+ CSCs is a major mechanism of hepatocarcinogenesis in cirrhotic livers.Oncogene advance online publication, 7 August 2017; doi:10.1038/onc.2017.272.</abstracttext>]",[],[],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/onc.2017.272']

PDGFRα has been reported to induce de novo synthesis of LAMB1 protein in a Sjogren syndrome antigen B (La/SSB)-dependent manner in a murine metastasis model. However, the role of this cascade in human HCC remains unclear. This study focused on the functional role of the PDGFRα-La/SSB-LAMB1 pathway and its molecular link to K19 expression in human HCC. In surgical HCC specimens from a cohort of 136 patients, PDGFRα expression correlated with K19 expression, microvascular invasion and metastatic spread. In addition, PDGFRα expression in pre-operative needle biopsy specimens predicted poor overall survival during a 5-year follow-up period. Consecutive histological staining demonstrated that the signaling components of the PDGFRα-La/SSB-LAMB1 pathway were strongly expressed at the invasive front. K19-positive HCC cells displayed high levels of α2β1 integrin (ITG) receptor, both in vitro and in vivo. In vitro activation of PDGFRα signaling triggered the translocation of nuclear La/SSB into the cytoplasm, enhanced the protein synthesis of LAMB1 by activating its internal ribosome entry site, which in turn led to increased secretion of laminin-111. This effect was abrogated by the PDGFRα-specific inhibitor crenolanib. Importantly LAMB1 stimulated ITG-dependent focal adhesion kinase/Src proto-oncogene non-receptor tyrosine kinase signaling. It also promoted the ITG-specific downstream target Rho-associated coiled-coil containing protein kinase 2, induced K19 expression in an autocrine manner, invadopodia formation and cell invasion. Finally, we showed that the knockdown of LAMB1 or K19 in subcutaneous xenograft mouse models resulted in significant loss of cells invading the surrounding stromal tissue and reduced HepG2 colonization into lung and liver after tail vein injection. The PDGFRα-LAMB1 pathway supports tumor progression at the invasive front of human HCC through K19 expression.Oncogene advance online publication, 7 August 2017; doi:10.1038/onc.2017.260.</abstracttext>]",[],[],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/onc.2017.260']

GSPE increased the expression of nuclear factor erythroid 2 (NF-E2)-related factor 2 (Nrf2), NAD(P)H dehydrogenase[quinine] 1(NQO1), heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) and glutamate-cysteine ligase catalytic subunit (GCLC). We conclude that grape seed procyanidin extract prevents the majority of tissue and molecular damage resulting from nanoparticle treatment. The protective effect of GSPE may be due to its strong antioxidative activities which related with the activated Nrf2 and its down-regulated genes including NQO1, HO-1 and GCLC.</abstracttext>]","[<div class=""keywords""><h4>KEYWORDS: </h4><p>Grape seed procyanidin extract; Nanotoxicology; Nrf2; Oxidative stress; Titanium dioxide nanoparticles</p></div>]",[],['https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0009-2797(17)30538-0']

Cytokines, including interleukin 24 (IL-24), play an important role in HCC. IL-24 inhibits HCC metastasis but the molecular mechanism by which this occurs is still unknown. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are regulators of cancers including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the role that miRNAs play in the regulation of IL-24 in HCC is unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of regulation of IL-24 by miR-203a-3p.1 on liver cancer cell proliferation and metastasis. IL-24 mRNA and miR-203a-3p.1 were detected by real-time RT-PCR, and IL-24 protein in the cell growth medium was measured by ELISA. A luciferase assay was used to verify that the IL-24 gene was the target of miR-203a-3p.1. Cell survival ability was detected by the MTT assay and colony formation. Cell metastasis was assayed by the Transwell system. The results showed that IL-24 could be down-regulated by miR-203a-3p.1 in HCC cells and that miR-203a-3p.1 acted as an onco-miRNA by targeting IL-24. Inhibition of miR-203a-3p.1 in cells could lead to the reversal of HCC cell proliferation and metastasis.

In total, 362 patients (53 with AFP-SGC and 309 with non-AFP-SGC) were included in the present study. Patients with AFP-SGC had significantly higher levels of lymphovascular invasion, perineural invasion (PNI), rate of liver metastasis, and stage IV cancer compared with patients with non-AFP-SGC (P&lt;0.05). The median overall survival (OS) rate was 12.6 months in the AFP-SGC group, and 22.1 months in the non-AFP-SGC group (P&lt;0.001). The median OS and disease free survival (DFS) of patients with stage I-III AFP-SGC were 28.1 and 13.4 months, respectively, whereas for patients with non-AFP-SGC, the OS and DFS were 45.3 and 38.0 months, respectively (P=0.01; P=0.02). The median OS for the stage IV AFP-SGC and non-AFP-SGC groups was 9.3 and 11.5 months, respectively (P=0.14). Multivariate analysis of the entire patient group revealed that the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance score of ≥2, lymph node involvement, presence of PNI, high levels of carcinoembryonic antigen, and distant metastasis were significantly correlated with OS. The lymph node involvement, ECOG performance score of ≥2, AFP-SGC type, and weight loss at diagnosis were also significant factors influencing the DFS in the stage I-III group.

The results indicated that the expression of TMC8 was significantly upregulated in HCC tissues and associated with metastasis and hepatitis B virus infection. According to the analysis of the overall survival using Cox proportional hazard regression model, higher expression of TMC8 was associated with a poorer prognosis and the overexpression of TMC8 was an independent risk factor for HCC.

In the last few years, treatments for HCC have significantly improved from a mere surgical resection to a series of minimally invasive therapies and targeted drugs. However, recurrence frequently occurs even upon curative therapeutics, and drug therapies generally produce disappointing results, with the overall prognosis dismal. This challenging clinical scenario warrants new effective and life-prolonging strategies for patients with HCC. Compelling evidence suggests that NK cells play a critical role in the immune function of the liver and in the immune defenses against HCC, indicating that HCC might be an ideal target for NK cell-based immunotherapies. To obtain comprehensive insights into the putative influence of NK cells on HCC, this paper summarizes current knowledge on NK cells in HCC and discusses the usefulness and prospects of NK cell-based immunotherapies. Critical issues that require consideration for the successful clinical translation of NK cell-based therapies are also addressed.

Clinical intervention during the early stages of hepatic fibrosis can slow the development of liver cirrhosis and reduce the risk of developing liver cancer. Performing a liver biopsy, the gold standard for viral liver disease management, has drawbacks such as invasiveness and a relatively high sampling error rate. Real-time tissue elastography (RTE), one of the most recently developed technologies, might be promising imaging technology because it is both noninvasive and provides accurate assessments of hepatic fibrosis. However, determining the stage of liver fibrosis from RTE images in a clinic is a challenging task. In this study, in contrast to the previous liver fibrosis index (LFI) method, which predicts the stage of diagnosis using RTE images and multiple regression analysis, we employed four classical classifiers (i.e., Support Vector Machine, Naïve Bayes, Random Forest and K-Nearest Neighbor) to build a decision-support system to improve the hepatitis B stage diagnosis performance. Eleven RTE image features were obtained from 513 subjects who underwent liver biopsies in this multicenter collaborative research. The experimental results showed that the adopted classifiers significantly outperformed the LFI method and that the Random Forest(RF) classifier provided the highest average accuracy among the four machine algorithms.

New inhibitors of hepatitis B virus entry, replication, assembly, or secretion and immune modulatory therapies are in development. The introduction of these novel compounds for chronic hepatitis B necessitates a standardised appraisal of the efficacy and safety of these treatments and definitions of new or additional endpoints to inform clinical trials. To move the field forward and to expedite the pathway from discovery to regulatory approval, a workshop with key stakeholders was held in September 2016 to develop a consensus on treatment endpoints to guide the design of clinical trials aimed at hepatitis B cure. The consensus reached was that a complete sterilising cure, i.e., viral eradication from the host, is unlikely to be feasible. Instead, a functional cure characterised by sustained loss of hepatitis B surface antigen with or without hepatitis B surface antibody seroconversion, which is associated with improved clinical outcomes, in a higher proportion of patients than is currently achieved with existing treatments is a feasible goal. Development of standardised assays for novel biomarkers toward better defining hepatitis B virus cure should occur in parallel with development of novel antiviral and immune modulatory therapies such that approval of new treatments can be linked to the approval of new diagnostic assays used to measure efficacy or to predict response.

Currently, once a liver metastasis is detected, the process of finding the primary site is challenging, time-consuming, and requires multiple examinations. The proposed system can support the human expert in localizing the search for the cancer source by prioritizing the examinations to probable cancer sites.</abstracttext>, <abstracttext label=""MATERIALS AND METHODS"" nlmcategory=""METHODS"">The suggested method is a learning-based approach, using computed tomography (CT) data as the input source. Each metastasis is circumscribed by a radiologist in portal phase and in non-contrast CT images. Visual features are computed from these images, combined into feature vectors, and classified using support vector machine classification. A variety of different features were explored and tested. A leave-one-out cross-validation technique was conducted for classification evaluation. The methods were developed on a set of 50 lesion cases taken from 29 patients.</abstracttext>, <abstracttext label=""RESULTS"" nlmcategory=""RESULTS"">Experiments were conducted on a separate set of 142 lesion cases taken from 71 patients with four different primary sites.

We have shown that the oncoprotein gankyrin is critical for inflammation-induced tumorigenesis in the colon. Although the in vitro function of gankyrin is well known, its role in vivo remains to be elucidated. We investigated the effect of gankyrin in the tumor microenvironment of mice with liver parenchymal cell-specific gankyrin ablation (Alb-Cre;gankyrin<sup>f/f</sup> ) and gankyrin deletion both in liver parenchymal and non-parenchymal cells (Mx1-Cre;gankyrin<sup>f/f</sup> ). Gankyrin upregulates vascular endothelial growth factor expression in tumor cells. Gankyrin binds to Src homology 2 domain-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase-1 (SHP-1), mainly expressed in liver non-parenchymal cells, resulting in phosphorylation and activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3). Gankyrin deficiency in non-parenchymal cells, but not in parenchymal cells, reduced STAT3 activity, interleukin (IL)-6 production, and cancer stem cell marker (Bmi1 and epithelial cell adhesion molecule [EpCAM]) expression, leading to attenuated tumorigenic potential. Chronic inflammation enhances gankyrin expression in the human liver. Gankyrin expression in the tumor microenvironment is negatively correlated with progression-free survival in patients undergoing sorafenib treatment for HCC. Thus, gankyrin appears to play a critical oncogenic function in tumor microenvironment and may be a potential target for developing therapeutic and preventive strategies against HCC.</abstracttext>]","[<div class=""keywords""><h4>KEYWORDS: </h4><p>

Our results showed that GSK-3β expression was significantly lower in human HCC cell lines with high metastatic potential than that in HCC cell lines without metastatic characteristics or in a normal human liver cell line. The knockdown of GSK-3β by siRNA led to a decreased expression of the epithelial junction molecules (ZO-1, E-cadherin) and an increase in the expression of a mesenchymal cell marker (α-SMA) and a gene transcription factor (β-catenin), resulting in enhanced tumor cell dissemination.

Therefore, sporadic AD is no longer a purely medical problem, but rather a social challenge when someone asks oneself: ""What can I do in my own adulthood to reduce the risk of sporadic AD at my old age to save the years of my lifespan from the destruction caused by it?"" Here, we combine two computational approaches for regulatory SNPs: Web service SNP_TATA_Comparator for sequence analysis and a PubMed-based keyword search for articles on the biochemical markers of diseases. Our purpose was to try to find answers to the question: ""What can be done in adulthood to reduce the risk of sporadic AD in old age to prevent the lifespan reduction caused by it?"" As a result, we found 89 candidate SNP markers of familial and sporadic AD (e.g., rs562962093 is associated with sporadic AD in the elderly as a complication of stroke in adulthood, where natural marine diets can reduce risks of both diseases in case of the minor allele of this SNP). In addition, rs768454929, and rs761695685 correlate with sporadic AD as a comorbidity of short stature, where maximizing stature in childhood and adolescence as an integral indicator of health can minimize (or even eliminate) the risk of sporadic AD in the elderly. After validation by clinical protocols, these candidate SNP markers may become interesting to the general population [may help to choose a lifestyle (in childhood, adolescence, and adulthood) that can reduce the risks of sporadic AD, its comorbidities, and complications in the elderly].</abstracttext>]","[<div class=""keywords""><h4>KEYWORDS: </h4><p>Alzheimer's disease; SNP marker; TATA-binding protein; TBP-binding site; expression change; gene; promoter; single nucleotide polymorphism</p></div>]",[],"['https://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fnagi.2017.00231', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmid/28775688/']"

Stability of HIFs is regulated by multi-step reactions including recognition by the von Hippel-Lindau tumour suppressor protein (pVHL) in association with an E3 ligase complex. Here we show that pVHL physically interacts with fatty acid synthase (FASN), displacing the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. This results in HIF-α protein stabilization and activation of HIF target genes even in normoxia such as during adipocyte differentiation. 25-hydroxycholesterol (25-OH), an inhibitor of FASN expression, also inhibited HIF target gene expression in cultured cells and in mouse liver. Clinically, FASN is frequently upregulated in a broad variety of cancers and has been reported to have an oncogenic function. We found that upregulation of FASN correlated with induction of many HIF target genes, notably in a malignant subtype of prostate tumours.

However, the mechanisms that drive development of HCC in a steatotic microenvironment remain unknown. Here we report that the obesity-associated protein JCAD is expressed at significantly higher levels in human NASH-HCC specimens compared to peri-carcinoma specimens. High JCAD expression was verified in multiple hepatoma cell lines. Forced overexpression of JCAD in hepatoma cells promoted tumor growth and proliferation; whereas JCAD silencing yielded opposite effects. JCAD interacted with the kinase domain of the tumor suppressor kinase LATS2, a core component of the Hippo signaling pathway. JCAD overexpression inhibited the ability of LATS2 to phosphorylate YAP in this pathway, in turn upregulating CCND1 and GLI2 to promote hepatoma cell proliferation. JCAD was induced by fatty acid overload in hepatic cells and was highly expressed in a mouse model of NASH-precarcinoma lesions, where the ratio of phospho-YAP to YAP was decreased. In human NASH-HCC specimens, JCAD expression and YAP phosphorylation patterns paralleled with the mouse model. Our findings illuminate a new role for JCAD and its critical interplay in the Hippo signaling cascade during the transition of NASH to HCC, with potential implications for therapeutic development in this setting.</abstracttext>]",[],[],['http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=28775168']

Combination of EMSA experiments and bioinformatic analyses led to the identification of an atypical and conserved IRE in the 3' untranslated region of <i>Pfn2</i> mRNA. <i>Pfn2</i> mRNA levels were significantly reduced in duodenal samples from mice with intestinal-IRP ablation, suggesting that IRPs exert a positive effect on <i>Pfn2</i> mRNA expression in vivo. Over-expression of Pfn2 in HeLa and Hepa1-6 cells reduced their metabolically active iron pool. Importantly, Pfn2-deficient mice showed iron accumulation in discrete areas of the brain (olfactory bulb, hippocampus and midbrain) and reduction of the hepatic iron store without anaemia. In spite of low liver iron levels, hepatic hepcidin expression remained high, likely due to compensatory activation of <i>Hepcidin</i> by mild inflammation.

Bioinformatic analyses including gene ontology (GO), KEGG pathway and circRNA/microRNA interaction network analysis were applied to predict the potential functions of circRNAs.

In the tumor microenvironment, tumor cells can escape the host immune response through the interaction of PD-1 and PD-L, which inhibits the function of T cells and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes while increasing the function of immunosuppressive T regulatory cells. The use of an anti-PD-1/PD-L blockade enables reprogramming of the immune system to efficiently identify and kill tumor cells.

IOUS is not widely used by colorectal surgeons during primary resection for CRC. Confident use of IOUS/CE-IOUS during primary resection of CRC may improve decision-making by providing the most sensitive form of liver staging even when compared with magnetic resonance imaging. This may be particularly important in the era of laparoscopic resections, where the colorectal surgeon loses the opportunity to palpate the liver.

A sub-lethal dose of taxol induced ABCB1 protein expression in taxol-resistant SKOV3 cells. Inactivation of TLR4 using chemical inhibitors (CLI-095 and AO-I) downregulated ABCB1 protein expression and enhanced the cytotoxic activity of taxol in taxol-resistant SKOV3 cells. While the sensitization effect of TLR4 inactivation was also detected in TOV21G ovarian cancer cells, which express moderate level of TLR4, ectopic expression of ABCB1 prevented the sensitization effect in these cells.

We contend that severe liver disease (cirrhosis or hepatocellular cancer) is not at all uncommon among older males with hereditary hemochromatosis. Our review of the published data from a variety of empirical sources indicates that roughly 1 in 10 male HFE C282Y homozygotes is likely to develop severe liver disease during his lifetime unless iron overload is detected early and treated. New evidence from a randomized controlled trial of treatment allows for evidence-based management of presymptomatic patients.

Furthermore, PEDF expression led to changes in cell morphology and the expression of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related markers via ERK1/2 signaling pathway, including the upregulation of N-cadherin and slug, and the downregulation of E-cadherin in HCC cells. Our results further showed that PEDF could interact with laminin receptor (LR) and LR knockdown attenuated PEDF-induced migration, invasion and the change of EMT-related markers. More importantly, in clinical HCC specimens, we found that PEDF expression was correlated with subcellular localization of LR, and that high expression of PEDF and positive expression of LR predicted a poor prognosis. In conclusion, our results demonstrate a novel functional role of PEDF/LR axis in driving metastasis through ERK1/2-mediated EMT in HCC and provided a promising prognostic marker in HCC.</abstracttext>]",[],[],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/cddis.2017.359']

In particular, the overexpression of AFP-L3 is associated with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Accordingly, several hospitals have begun to employ the ratio of AFP-L3 to the total AFP level (AFP-L3%) as new diagnostic evidence for HCC owing to its high diagnostic accuracy. However, current methods of detection for AFP and AFP-L3 are time-consuming, require multiple samples, and lack in sensitivity and specificity. Herein, we present a novel concept for the early diagnosis of HCC based on the combination of Raman frequency shift and intensity change, and developed surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS)-based immunochips via AFP-L3%. In the first step of the study, the frequency shift of 4-mercaptobenzoic acid (MBA) was applied for the quantitative determination of total AFP based on the AFP and anti-AFP interaction on MBA-modified silver chips. 5,5-Dithiobis(succinimidyl-2-nitrobenzoate) (DSNB)-modified immunogold was then incorporated with AFP-L3 antibodies for sandwich immunoreaction on the chips. As a result, we found that a typical Raman band intensity of DSNB presented an exponential linear relationship with the concentration of AFP-L3. Thus, the AFP-L3% can be calculated according to the concentrations of AFP-L3 and total AFP. The most important advantage of the proposed method is the combination of AFP-L3% and frequency shifts of SERS, which exhibits excellent reproducibility and high accuracy, and significantly simplifies the conventional detection procedure of AFP-L3%. Application of the proposed method with the serum of patients with HCC demonstrated its great potential in early liver cancer diagnosis.</abstracttext>]",[],[],['https://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.7b01349']

The World Health Organization guidelines for pharmacological treatments for children's persisting pain acknowledge that pain in children is a major public health concern of high significance in most parts of the world. While in the past, pain was largely dismissed and was frequently left untreated, views on children's pain have changed over time, and relief of pain is now seen as important.We designed a suite of seven reviews on chronic non-cancer pain and cancer pain (looking at antidepressants, antiepileptic drugs, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, opioids, and paracetamol as priority areas) in order to review the evidence for children's pain utilising pharmacological interventions in children and adolescents.As the leading cause of morbidity in children and adolescents in the world today, chronic disease (and its associated pain) is a major health concern. Chronic pain (lasting three months or longer) can arise in the paediatric population in a variety of pathophysiological classifications: nociceptive, neuropathic, idiopathic, visceral, nerve damage pain, chronic musculoskeletal pain, and chronic abdominal pain, and other unknown reasons.Paracetamol (acetaminophen) is one of the most widely used analgesics in both adults and children. The recommended dosage in the UK, Europe, Australia, and the USA for children and adolescents is generally 10 to 15 mg/kg every four to six hours, with specific age ranges from 60 mg (6 to 12 months old) up to 500 to 1000 mg (over 12 years old). Paracetamol is the only recommended analgesic for children under 3 months of age.

It occurs mainly as a consequence of the combined necrotic and apoptotic types of cell death. In order to study liver/hepatocyte injury by necrotic type of cell death, we studied signal-regulated necrosis (necroptosis) by newly developing an optic probe detecting receptor-interacting protein (RIP)1/RIP3 binding, an essential process for necroptosis induction. In the mouse hepatocyte cell line, TIB-73 cells, TNF-a/cycloheximide (T/C) induced RIP1/3 binding only when caspase activity was suppressed by z-VAD-fmk (zVAD), a caspase-specific inhibitor. T/C/zVADinduced RIP1/3-binding was inhibited by necrostatin-1 (Nec-1), an allosteric inhibitor of RIP1. The reduced cell survival by T/C/zVAD was improved by Nec-1. These facts indicate that T/C induces necroptosis of hepatocytes when apoptotic pathway is inhibited/unavailable. FasL also induced cell death which was only partially inhibited by zVAD, indicating the possible involvement of necroptosis other than apoptosis. FasL activated caspase-3 and, similarly, induced RIP1/3-binding when caspases were inactivated. Interestingly, FasL-induced RIP1/3 binding was significantly suppressed by the antioxidants, Trolox and N-acetyl cysteine (NAC), suggesting the involvement of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in FasL-induced necroptotic cellular processes. H₂O₂, by itself, induced RIP1/3 binding that was suppressed by Nec-1, but not by zVAD. Hypoxia induced RIP1/3 binding after reoxygenation, which was suppressed by Nec-1 or by the antioxidants. Cell death induced by hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) was also improved by Nec-1. Similar to H₂O₂, H/R did not require caspase inhibition for RIP1/3 binding, suggesting the involvement of a caspase-independent mechanism for non-ligand induced and/or redox-mediated necroptosis. These data indicate that ROS induce necroptosis, and mediate the FasL- and hypoxia-induced necroptosis via a molecular mechanism that differs from a conventional caspase-dependent pathway. In conclusion, necroptosis is potentially involved in liver/hepatocyte injury induced by oxidative stress and FasL, other than apoptosis.</abstracttext>]",[],[],['https://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/10.3727/096504017X15005102445191']

Different hypotheses have been proposed for its main mode of action. We quantified hepatic transcripts of male C57BL/6 mice exposed to graded levels of CR (0% to 40% CR) for three months, and evaluated the responses relative to these various hypotheses. Of the four main signaling pathways implied to be linked to the impact of CR on lifespan (insulin/insulin like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), nuclear factor-kappa beta (NF-ĸB), mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) and sirtuins (SIRTs)), all the pathways except SIRT were altered in a manner consistent with increased lifespan. However, the expression levels of SIRT4 and SIRT7 were decreased with increasing levels of CR. Changes consistent with altered fuel utilization under CR may reduce reactive oxygen species production, which was paralleled by reduced protection. Downregulated major urinary protein (MUP) transcription suggested reduced reproductive investment. Graded CR had a positive effect on autophagy and xenobiotic metabolism, and was protective with respect to cancer signaling. CR had no significant effect on fibroblast growth factor-21 (FGF21) transcription but affected transcription in the hydrogen sulfide production pathway.

One example, the hepatitis B virus, induces hepatic injury in human hepatocytes through dysregulation of aerobic glycolysis and lipid metabolism. Increased glycolytic metabolism mediated by elevated expression of Glut1, glucose influx, and lactate secretion is associated with this Warburg phenotype, a classic metabolic signature also observed in cancer cells. This article brings into focus the tight interaction between HBV infection and metabolic dysfunction and how these processes facilitate the progression of end-stage liver diseases, such as hepatocellular carcinoma.

Therefore, a more sensitive vimentin detection system may be useful for cancer screening and early detection. The V9 mouse monoclonal antibody (mAb), which recognizes the human vimentin protein, is widely used in routine pathology to identify mesenchymal cells using immunohistochemical analysis.

However, the underlying mechanism in HULC up-regulation is poorly understood. We hypothesized that HULC might modulate the oncogene high mobility group A2 (HMGA2) to promote hepatocarcinogenesis. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis showed that the expression levels of HULC were positively correlated with those of HMGA2 in clinical HCC tissues. Interestingly, we also observed that HULC could up-regulate HMGA2 in HCC cells. Mechanistically, we found that the microRNA-186 inhibited HMGA2 expression by targeting the 3'-untranslated region (3'UTR) of HMGA2 mRNA. Strikingly, HULC acted as a competing noncoding RNA to sequester miR-186 and thereby relieved miR-186-mediated HMGA2 repression. Functionally, HMGA2 knockdown decreased the HULC-enhanced growth of HCC cells both in vitro and in vivo. We conclude that the long noncoding RNA HULC increases HMGA2 expression by sequestering miR-186 post-transcripttionally and thereby promotes liver cancer growth, providing new insights into the mechanism by which HULC enhances hepatocarcinogenesis.</abstracttext>]","[<div class=""keywords""><h4>KEYWORDS: </h4><p>Up-regulated in liver cancer (HULC); cell proliferation; hepatocellular carcinoma; high mobility group A2 (HMGA2); long noncoding RNA (long ncRNA, lncRNA); microRNA (miRNA); microRNA-186; oncogene</p></div>]",[],['http://www.jbc.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=28765279']

Using an optimized humanized mouse model, we show that human NK cells, through the secretion of gamma interferon (IFN-γ), are critical in the early defense against DENV infection. Depletion of NK cells or neutralization of IFN-γ leads to increased viremia and more severe thrombocytopenia and liver damage in humanized mice. <i>In vitro</i> studies using autologous human NK cells show that DENV-infected monocyte-derived dendritic cells (MDDCs), but not monocytes, activate NK cells in a contact-dependent manner, resulting in upregulation of CD69 and CD25 and secretion of IFN-γ. Blocking adhesion molecules (LFA-1, DNAM-1, CD2, and 2β4) on NK cells abolishes NK cell activation, IFN-γ secretion, and the control of DENV replication. NK cells activated by infected MDDCs also inhibit DENV infection in monocytes. These findings show the essential role of human NK cells in protection against acute DENV infection <i>in vivo</i>, identify adhesion molecules and dendritic cells required for NK cell activation, and delineate the sequence of events for NK cell activation and protection against DENV infection.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> Dengue is a mosquito-transmitted viral disease with a range of symptoms, from mild fever to life-threatening dengue hemorrhagic fever. The diverse disease manifestation is thought to result from a complex interplay between viral and host factors. Using mice engrafted with a human immune system, we show that human NK cells inhibit virus infection through secretion of the cytokine gamma interferon and reduce disease pathogenesis, including depletion of platelets and liver damage. During a natural infection, DENV initially infects dendritic cells in the skin. We find that NK cells interact with infected dendritic cells through physical contact mediated by adhesion molecules and become activated before they can control virus infection.

This wireless induction heating had few side effects when it was extensively applied to cancer treatment. The effects of hyperthermia strongly depend on the precise control of temperature. However, during the treatment process, the control performance is degraded due to severe perturbations and parameter variations. In this study, a modified self-learning fuzzy logic controller (SLFLC) with a gain tuning mechanism was implemented to obtain high control performance in a wide range of treatment situations. This implementation was performed by appropriately altering the output scaling factor of a fuzzy inverse model to adjust the control rules. In this study, the proposed SLFLC was compared to the classical self-tuning fuzzy logic controller and fuzzy model reference learning control.

New inhibitors of hepatitis B virus entry, replication, assembly, or secretion and immune modulatory therapies are in development. The introduction of these novel compounds for chronic hepatitis B necessitates a standardized appraisal of the efficacy and safety of these treatments and definitions of new or additional endpoints to inform clinical trials. To move the field forward and to expedite the pathway from discovery to regulatory approval, a workshop with key stakeholders was held in September 2016 to develop a consensus on treatment endpoints to guide the design of clinical trials aimed at hepatitis B cure. The consensus reached was that a complete sterilizing cure, i.e., viral eradication from the host, is unlikely to be feasible. Instead, a functional cure characterized by sustained loss of hepatitis B surface antigen with or without hepatitis B surface antibody seroconversion, which is associated with improved clinical outcomes, in a higher proportion of patients than is currently achieved with existing treatments is a feasible goal. Development of standardized assays for novel biomarkers toward better defining hepatitis B virus cure should occur in parallel with development of novel antiviral and immune modulatory therapies such that approval of new treatments can be linked to the approval of new diagnostic assays used to measure efficacy or to predict response. Combination of antiviral and immune modulatory therapies will likely be needed to achieve functional hepatitis B virus cure. Limited proof-of-concept monotherapy studies to evaluate safety and antiviral activity should be conducted prior to proceeding to combination therapies. The safety of any new curative therapies will be paramount given the excellent safety of currently approved nucleos(t)ide analogues.

Cellular uptake of ABG-PNs was controlled by specific clathrin-mediated endocytosis. In addition, ABG-PNs showed improved drug pharmacokinetics with an increased area under the curve value (a 1.73-fold increase) and a decreased elimination clearance (37.8% decrease). The nanomicelles showed increased drug concentrations in the liver and lung. In contrast, drug concentrations in both heart and brain were decreased.

Patients usually present with high fever, cytopenias, hyperferritinemia, and hepatosplenomegaly, and their disease process ranges from mild to fatal multiorgan failure. HLH is a heterogeneous group of disorders that can be triggered by infections, neoplasms, or autoimmune diseases. The HLH diagnosis can be difficult to confidently confirm in critically ill patients while waiting for pathology or reference laboratory results to return, delaying the diagnosis with significantly worsened outcomes. The current HLH-2004 diagnostic guidelines were originally developed for pediatric cases and were not validated to diagnose secondary HLH, whether in children or adults. In addition, some laboratory findings that are common among HLH patients such as hypoalbuminemia and elevated liver enzymes are not represented in the HLH-2004 guidelines. Even more challenging for clinicians is that many of the diagnostic features of this syndrome are nonspecific. For example, the clinical presentation of HLH can meet the diagnostic criteria of systemic inflammatory response syndrome, viral infections, or neoplastic diseases. It is necessary to revisit the diagnostic criteria for HLH by validating the clinical and laboratory findings in large prospective HLH prospective clinical trials or by establishing registries.

Physical activity is inversely associated with and sedentary behaviour is positively (and independently) associated with an increased risk of more than ten types of cancer, including colorectal cancer (and advanced adenomas), endometrial cancers, and breast cancer. The most consistent dietary risk factor for premalignant and invasive breast cancer is alcohol, whether consumed during early or late adult life, even at low levels.

Obesity is a key contributory factor associated with cancer risk and mortality, including in dose-response associations in endometrial and post-menopausal breast cancer, and in degree and duration of fatty liver disease-related hepatocellular carcinoma. Obesity produces an inflammatory state, characterised by macrophages clustered around enlarged hypertrophied, dead, and dying adipocytes, forming crown-like structures. Increased concentrations of aromatase and interleukin 6 in inflamed breast tissue and an increased number of macrophages, compared with healthy tissue, are also observed in women with normal body mass index, suggesting a metabolic obesity state.

In this work, analysis of minimal commonly deleted 8p segments to identify candidate TSG implicated GATA4, a master transcription factor driver of hepatocyte epithelial lineage fate.

Lycopene is an antioxidant and phytonutrient from the carotenoid family. The health benefits of lycopene are prominent against cancer and cardiovascular, lung, liver, and skin problems. Recent studies have demonstrated the hepatoprotective, antidyslipidemic, and antioxidant roles of lycopene. The current study was designed to appraise the ability of lycopene to prevent mitochondrial dysfunction during the d-GalN/LPS-induced FHF. The administration of d-GalN/LPS (300 mg and 30 μg/kg body weight, respectively) to the experimental rats induced several disturbances in mitochondrial function. The lipid peroxide and hydrogen peroxide levels were increased (p &lt; 0.05).

Molecular modeling results obtained show evidence that lycopene inhibits several lipoxygenases and provides rationale for the observed prevention of lipid peroxidation in the mitochondrial membrane.

Only a small percentage of HCC patients (~20%-30%) are diagnosed at an early stage when first-line treatment options may be effective. The majority of HCC patients (&gt;70%) are diagnosed with unresectable disease and given a poor overall prognosis. Current treatment guidelines recommend locoregional therapy with transarterial chemoembolisation (TACE) and systemic therapy with sorafenib as first-line treatment for patients with intermediate and advanced stage HCC. However, multiple factors including contraindications, technical considerations and treatment-related toxicities pose significant challenges in achieving favourable treatment outcomes, underscoring the need for a paradigm shift in managing these patients. In 2002, yttrium-90 (Y-90) resin microspheres was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of unresectable metastatic colorectal cancer to the liver with adjuvant floxuridine chemotherapy. However, thousands of patients with unresectable HCC have also been treated with resin Y-90.

HT1 has been transformed in the last 50 years from an aggressive often undiagnosed childhood disease causing liver failure or liver cancer, with infant death in most patients, to a condition that is detectable at birth, and for which treatment with nitisinone (NTBC) and diet can prevent detectable liver or kidney abnormalities. What challenges remain? The properties of the affected metabolic pathway and the broad spectrum of severity seen in untreated patients are incompletely understood but potentially important for patients. Available treatments have potential complications, including liver transplantation (risks of surgery and of immunosuppression to prevent rejection), nitisinone and diet therapy (hypertyrosinemia, corneal opacities, nutritional imbalances and possibly developmental delay). The detection of liver cancer is imperfect and laborious. The effects of tyrosinemia during pregnancy are little-known. Although animal models of HT1 are becoming standard research tools in cell replacement and gene modification therapy, these techniques are not currently applicable to HT1 itself. Treatment adherence is variable, causing concern about long term outcome for some patients. Around the world, there are great disparities in the diagnosis and treatment of HT1. Most affected individuals are born in places where newborn screening for HT1 is not performed and where appropriate treatment is not available. We hope that this list will help to focus on some of these remaining obstacles to a cure for HT1.</abstracttext>]","[<div class=""keywords""><h4>KEYWORDS: </h4><p>Adherence; Cancer; Cornea; Development; Eye; Tyrosinemia</p></div>]",[],['https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-55780-9_19']

Several studies documented that T2DM is closely associated with an increased incidence of cancer. However, while some methodological considerations preclude a definitive association between T2DM and the risk of certain cancers, the relationship between T2DM and increased risk of incident hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains significant even after adjustment for detection bias and reverse causation, indicating that such association is clinically reliable and robust. In addition, a number of observational studies also showed that T2DM is associated with higher mortality among persons with HCC. Some recent meta-analyses suggested that treatment with metformin may be associated with a lower risk of HCC, and may also beneficially influence HCC prognosis, whereas treatment with sulphonylureas or insulin seems to be related to a higher HCC risk. The underlying biological mechanisms linking T2DM and HCC are complex and difficult to elucidate, but the existence of close inter-connections among T2DM, obesity and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) induces hepatic/systemic insulin resistance and causes the release of multiple pro-inflammatory cytokines, vasoactive factors and pro-oxidant molecules, which are all potentially implicated in the development and progression of HCC. In this clinical review, we discuss the epidemiological evidence linking T2DM to the risk of HCC. Moreover, we also briefly discuss the putative underlying mechanisms linking T2DM, NAFLD and HCC, and the potential effect of certain hypoglycemic agents on the risk of developing HCC.</abstracttext>]","[<div class=""keywords""><h4>KEYWORDS: </h4><p>Diabetes; cancer; hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC); nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)</p></div>]",[],"['http://dx.doi.org/10.21037/atm.2017.04.41', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmid/28758096/']"

Einige frühere Studien haben gezeigt, dass das ILC und das häufiger anzutreffende invasiv-duktale Karzinom (IDC) jeweils eigene Metastasierungsmuster aufweisen. Soweit uns bekannt ist, beschränken sich diese Daten auf die Lokalisation der ersten Fernrezidive. Ziel dieser Studie war es, die Metastasierungsmuster von ILC und IDC bei den ersten Fernrezidiven sowie über den gesamten Verlauf der Metastasierung zu vergleichen. <b>Methoden</b> Grundlage der Studie war eine prospektiv zusammengestellte Datenbank von Patientinnen mit metastasiertem Brustkrebs. Brustkrebsrezidive bzw. Metastasen wurden nach deren Lokalisation klassifiziert, und die Daten wurden einer deskriptiven Analyse unterzogen. <b>Ergebnisse</b> Unter 761 Patientinnen wurde bei 88 (11,6%) die Diagnose ILC gestellt und bei 673 (88,4%) die Diagnose IDC. Bei Patientinnen mit ILC traten die ersten Fernrezidive häufiger in Form von Knochenmetastasen (56,8 vs. 37,7%, p = 0,001) und Metastasen des Magen-Darm-Trakts auf (5,7 vs. 0,3%, p &lt; 0,001) und nicht in Organen wie Lunge (5,7 vs. 24,2%, p &lt; 0,001) oder Leber (4,6 vs. 11,4%, p = 0,049).

Patients with ILC showed more frequent metastases to the bone (56.8 vs. 37.7%, p = 0.001) and gastrointestinal (GI) tract (5.7 vs. 0.3%, p &lt; 0.001) as first site of distant recurrence, and less to organs such as lung (5.7 vs. 24.2%, p &lt; 0.001) and liver (4.6 vs. 11.4%, p = 0.049). Over the entire course of metastatic disease, more patients with ILC had ovarian (5.7 vs. 2.1%, p = 0.042) and GI tract metastases (8.0 vs. 0.6%, p &lt; 0.001), also demonstrating reduced tendency to metastasize to the liver (20.5 vs. 49.0%, p &lt; 0.001) and lung (23.9 vs. 51.9%, p &lt; 0.001). All associations but bone held after sensitivity analysis on hormonal status. Although patients presenting with ILC were noted to have more advanced stage at presentation, recurrence-free survival in these patients was increased (4.8 years vs. 3.2 years, p = 0.017).

Here, we show that hepatic RORα controls lipid homeostasis by negatively regulating transcriptional activity of peroxisome proliferators-activated receptor-γ (PPARγ) that mediates hepatic lipid metabolism. Liver-specific Rorα-deficient mice develop hepatic steatosis, obesity and insulin resistance when challenged with a high-fat diet (HFD). Global transcriptome analysis reveals that liver-specific deletion of Rorα leads to the dysregulation of PPARγ signaling and increases hepatic glucose and lipid metabolism. RORα specifically binds and recruits histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) to PPARγ target promoters for the transcriptional repression of PPARγ. PPARγ antagonism restores metabolic homeostasis in HFD-fed liver-specific Rorα deficient mice. Our data indicate that RORα has a pivotal role in the regulation of hepatic lipid homeostasis. Therapeutic strategies designed to modulate RORα activity may be beneficial for the treatment of metabolic disorders.Hepatic steatosis development may result from dysregulation of lipid metabolism, which is finely tuned by several transcription factors including the PPAR family.

Evidence is mounting that in cholangiocarcinoma, tumor epithelial cells establish an intricate web of mutual interactions with multiple stromal components, largely determining the pervasive behavior of the tumor. The main cellular components of the tumor microenvironment (i.e. myofibroblasts, macrophages, lymphatic endothelial cells), which has been recently termed as 'tumor reactive stroma', are recruited and activated by neoplastic cells, and in turn, deleteriously mold tumor behavior by releasing a huge variety of paracrine signals, including cyto/chemokines, growth factors, morphogens and proteinases. An abnormally remodeled and stiff extracellular matrix favors and supports these cell interactions. Although the mechanisms responsible for the generation of tumor reactive stroma are largely uncertain, hypoxia presumably plays a central role.

In vitro investigations with the pancreatic carcinoma cell lines BxPC-3 and MIA PaCa-2 revealed no significant differences to off-target cells in the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC<sub>50</sub> ) for the fusion protein. In contrast, combination with SO1861 decreased the IC<sub>50</sub> for BxPC-3 cells from 100 nM to 0.17 nM, whereas control cells remained unaffected. Monotherapy of BxPC-3 xenografts in CD-1 nude mice led to a 51.7% average reduction in tumor size (40.8 mm<sup>3</sup> ) when compared to placebo, however, combined treatment with SO1861 resulted in a more than 13-fold better efficacy (3.0 mm<sup>3</sup> average tumor size) with complete regression in 80% of cases. Immunohistochemical analyses showed that tumor cells with lower target receptor expression are, in contrast to the combination therapy, able to escape from the monotherapy, which finally results in tumor growth.

Cell-based assays using synthetic TCF/LEF (T-cell factor/lymphoid enhancer factor) reporters, as readouts of β-catenin/TCF-dependent transcriptional activity, have contributed greatly to the discovery of small molecules that modulate Wnt signaling. In the present study, we report a novel screening method, called a bidirectional dual reporter assay. Integrated transcriptome analysis identified a histidine ammonia-lyase gene (HAL) that was negatively regulated by β-catenin/TCF-dependent transcriptional activity. We leveraged a promoter region of the HAL gene as another transcriptional readout of Wnt signaling. Cells stably expressing both an optimized HAL reporter and the TCF/LEF reporter enabled bidirectional reporter activities in response to Wnt signaling. Increased HAL reporter activity and decreased TCF/LEF reporter activity were observed simultaneously in the cells when β-catenin/TCF7L2 was inhibited. Notably, this method could decrease the number of false positives observed when screening an inhibitor library compared with the conventional TCF/LEF assay.

The inclusion of as many cDMCs as possible helps improve the accuracy of cancer diagnosis and sometimes identify cancer subtypes. However, the lack of an established method for the analysis of 100s of cDMCs practically impedes their robust use in clinical medicine. Here, we tested the availability of targeted bisulfite-PCR-sequencing (TBPseq) technology for the assessment of methylation levels of a myriad of CpGs scattered over the genome. In randomly selected 46 cancer cell lines, multiplexed PCR yielded a variety of amplicons harboring 246 CpGs residing at promoters of 97 cancer-associated genes, all of which were sequenced in the same flow cell. Clustering analysis of the TBPseq-assessed methylation levels of target CpGs showed that the lung and liver cancer cell lines correlated relatively strongly with each other while they weakly correlated with colon cancer cells. CpGs at the <i>LIFR</i> gene promoter, which are known to be hypermethylated in colon cancers, indeed were heavily methylated in the tested colon cancer cells. Moreover, the <i>LIFR</i> promoter hypermethylation was found in colon cancer cells only, but not in biliary tract, liver, lung, and stomach cancers cell lines. A meta-analysis with public cancer methylome data verified the colon cancer specificity of <i>LIFR</i> promoter methylation.

Most patients present in their first months of life with liver failure, but others can present later with issues of compensated cirrhosis, renal tubulopathy or acute intermittent porphyria. If patients survive the acute phase with liver failure or if they present later with compensated cirrhosis, they often develop hepatocellular carcinoma early but also later in life. The course of the disease changed after the introduction of 2-(2 nitro-4-3 trifluoro-methylbenzoyl)-1, 3-cyclohexanedione (NTBC), which blocks the tyrosine degradation pathway at an earlier step. Therefore, the toxic products did not accumulate anymore and all clinical problems resolved. However, the risk (although clearly decreased) for developing liver cancer remained, especially if NTBC treatment is initiated late, a slow decrease of the tumor marker α-fetoprotein is seen or if the α-fetoprotein concentrations remain just above the normal range. A rise of α-fetoprotein in these HT1 patients is more or less pathognomonic for liver cancer. Although hepatoblastoma development occurs in HT1 patients, most HT1 patients develop hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) or a mixed type of carcinoma consisting of HCC and hepatoblastoma. Due to the small risk of liver cancer development, screening for liver cancer (especially HCC) is still recommended in HT1 patients using regular measures of α-fetoprotein and imaging. Ultrasound is mostly the modality of choice for surveillance, because it is widely available, it does not use radiation and is noninvasive. When a suspicious lesion is present, the higher sensitivity of MRI could be used for characterization and staging of lesions. At this moment, no HCC development in pre-symptomatically treated patients is reported. These different situations could possibly indicate that NTBC can prevent the start of the development of HCC when initiated early, but can't stop the development of HCC if it is prescribed at a later stage, stressing the importance of early diagnosis.</abstracttext>]","[<div class=""keywords""><h4>KEYWORDS: </h4><p>AFP; HCC; Hepatocellular carcinoma; Liver cancer; MRI; Tyrosinemia; Ultrasound</p></div>]",[],['https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-55780-9_9']

Although sorafenib, an orally administered multikinase inhibitor, has produced survival benefits for patients with advanced HCC, favorable clinical outcomes are limited due to individual differences and resistance. The application of immunotherapy, a promising approach for HCC is urgently needed. Macrophage infiltration, mediated by the CCL2/CCR2 axis, is a potential immunotherapeutic target. Here, we report that a natural product from Abies georgei, named 747 and related in structure to kaempferol, exhibits sensitivity and selectivity as a CCR2 antagonist. The specificity of 747 on CCR2 was demonstrated via calcium flux, the binding domain of CCR2 was identified in an extracellular loop by chimera binding assay, and in vivo antagonistic activity of 747 was confirmed through a thioglycollate-induced peritonitis model. In animals, 747 elevated the number of CD8+ T cells in tumors via blocking tumor-infiltrating macrophage-mediated immunosuppression and inhibited orthotopic and subcutaneous tumor growth in a CD8+ T cell-dependent manner. Further, 747 enhanced the therapeutic efficacy of low-dose sorafenib without obvious toxicity, through elevating the numbers of intra-tumoral CD8+ T cells and increasing death of tumor cells. Thus, we have discovered a natural CCR2 antagonist and have provided a new perspective on development of this antagonist for treatment of HCC. In mouse models of HCC, 747 enhanced the tumor immunosuppressive microenvironment and potentiated the therapeutic effect of sorafenib, indicating that the combination of an immunomodulator with a chemotherapeutic drug could be a new approach for treating HCC.</abstracttext>]","[<div class=""keywords""><h4>KEYWORDS: </h4><p>Combination therapy; Experimental therapeutics; Immunotherapy; Kaempferol; Preclinical models</p></div>]",[],"['https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2352-3964(17)30287-6', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmid/28754304/']"

An additional signature matches the spectrum of translesion DNA polymerase eta (POLH). In lymphoid cells, these mutations target promoters, consistent with AID-initiated somatic hypermutation. In solid tumors, however, they are associated with UV exposure and alcohol consumption and target the H3K36me3 chromatin of active genes in a mismatch repair (MMR)-dependent manner. These regions normally have a low mutation rate because error-free MMR also targets H3K36me3 chromatin.

Of particular interest is the study of omega-3 and omega-6 long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFAs), notably EPA (eicosapentaenoic acid, 20:5n-3), DHA (docosahexaenoic acid, 22:6n-3), and ARA (arachidonic acid, 20:4n-6), and their transformation into bioactive lipid mediators. In this sense, new families of PUFA-derived lipid mediators, including resolvins derived from EPA and DHA, and protectins and maresins derived from DHA, are being increasingly investigated because of their active role in the ""return to homeostasis"" process and resolution of inflammation. Recent findings reviewed in the present study highlight that the omega-6 fatty acid ARA appears increased, and omega-3 EPA and DHA decreased in most cancer tissues compared to normal ones, and that increments in omega-3 LC-PUFAs consumption and an omega-6/omega-3 ratio of 2-4:1, are associated with a reduced risk of breast, prostate, colon and renal cancers. Along with their lipid-lowering properties, omega-3 LC-PUFAs also exert cardioprotective functions, such as reducing platelet aggregation and inflammation, and controlling the presence of DHA in our body, especially in our liver and brain, which is crucial for optimal brain functionality. Considering that DHA is the principal omega-3 FA in cortical gray matter, the importance of DHA intake and its derived lipid mediators have been recently reported in patients with major depressive and bipolar disorders, Alzheimer disease, Parkinson's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. The present study reviews the relationships between major diseases occurring today in the Western world and LC-PUFAs. More specifically this review focuses on the dietary omega-3 LC-PUFAs and the omega-6/omega-3 balance, in a wide range of inflammation disorders, including autoimmune diseases. This review suggests that the current recommendations of consumption and/or supplementation of omega-3 FAs are specific to particular groups of age and physiological status, and still need more fine tuning for overall human health and well being.</abstracttext>]","[<div class=""keywords""><h4>KEYWORDS: </h4><p>Disease; Health; Inflammation; Lipidomics; Lipids; Long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids; Omega-3; Resolvins</p></div>]",[],"['https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s40169-017-0153-6', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmid/28752333/']"

Since its discovery in 1989, HCV research has been impeded by the lack of a robust infectious cell culture system and thus in vitro studies on diverse genetic backgrounds are hampered because of the limited number of hepatoma cell lines which are able to support different aspects of the HCV life cycle. In the current study, we sought to expand the limited number of permissive cells capable of supporting the diverse phases of the HCV life cycle. Initially, we screened a panel of new hepatoma-derived cell lines, designated BCLC-1, -2, -3, -4, -5, -6, -9 and -10 cells, for their ability to express essential HCV receptors and subsequently to support HCV entry by using the well-characterized HCV pseudoparticle system (HCVpp). Apart from BCLC-9, all BCLC cell lines were permissive for HCVpp infection. Next, BCLC cells were subjected to short- and long-term HCV RNA replication studies using HCV subgenomic replicons. Interestingly, only BCLC-1, -5 and -9 cells, supported short-term HCV RNA replication, but the latter were excluded from further studies since they were refractory for HCV entry. BCLC-1, -5 were able to support long-term HCV replication too; yet BCLC-5 cells supported the highest long-term HCV RNA replication levels. Furthermore, cured BCLC-5 clones from HCV subgenomic replicon, showed increased permissiveness for HCV RNA replication. Strikingly, we were unable to detect endogenous BCLC-5 miR122 expression - an important HCV host factor- and as expected, the exogenous expression of miR122 in BCLC-5 cells increased their permissiveness for HCV RNA replication. However, this cell line was unable to produce HCV infectious particles despite ectopic expression of apolipoprotein E, which in other hepatoma cell lines has been shown to be sufficient to enable the HCV secretion process, suggesting a lack of other host cellular factor(s) and/or the presence of inhibitory factor(s). In conclusion, the establishment of these new permissive cell lines for HCV entry and replication, which possess a different genetic background compared to the well-established models, expands the current repertoire of hepatoma cell lines susceptible to the study of the HCV life cycle and also will aid to further elucidate the cellular determinants that modulate HCV replication, assembly and egress.</abstracttext>]","[<div class=""keywords""><h4>KEYWORDS: </h4><p>Apolipoprotein E (ApoE); HCV RNA replication; HCV entry receptors; Hepatitis C virus; Permissive cell lines; microRNA 122</p></div>]",[],['https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0168-1702(17)30278-2']

The HCC incidence rate increased from 0.8/100 PY [CI95% 0.4 - 1.5] in 2002-2003 to 2.9/100 PY [2.4 - 3.4] in 2012-2013. One-year cumulative incidence of at least one AFP or US was 53% among all patients. The positive predictive value of an AFP ≥ 20 ng mL<sup>-1</sup> was 17%. Twenty-three (21%) patients were diagnosed with early stage HCC (stage 0/1) and 84 (79%) with late stage. Median survival after HCC for early stage HCC disease was 30.1 months and 7.4 months for advanced HCC (stage 2/3). The incidence rate of HCC increased over time among patients with hepatitis C and cirrhosis in Denmark. Application of AFP and US was suboptimal and most patients were diagnosed with advanced HCC with a poor prognosis. This article is protected by copyright.

Control of HCV requires vigorous T cell responses, yet CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in chronic HCV patients are dysfunctional. T follicular regulatory (Tfr) cells are a subset of regulatory T cells that suppress T follicular helper (Tfh) cells and the generation of high affinity antibody-producing B cells. In this study, we examined the accumulation of Tfr cells in the liver compartment during chronic HCV infection and defined the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying their expansion. Our analysis revealed a substantial population of Tfr cells in the livers of chronic HCV patients that is absent in liver tissues from non-viral hepatitis or healthy subjects. Co-culture of PBMCs from healthy subjects with HCV-infected hepatoma cells resulted in preferential expansion of circulating Tfr cells leading to the suppression of Tfh cells. Additionally, co-culture of tonsillar cells with infected hepatoma cells lead to an expansion of germinal center Tfr. Notably, expansion was mediated by TGF-β-containing exosomes released from HCV-infected hepatocytes as blockade of exosome-associated TGF-β or inhibition of exosome release abrogated Tfr expansion.</abstracttext>, <abstracttext label=""CONCLUSION"" nlmcategory=""CONCLUSIONS"">These results show that liver-derived exosomes play a pivotal role in the accumulation of Tfr cells, likely leading to suppression of Tfh responses in HCV-infected patients.

However, the expression and clinical significance of miR-204-5p in hepatocellular carcinoma has not been investigated. The aim of this study is to examine the relationship between miR-204-5p expression and clinicopathological features in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) as well as to predict the relevant signaling pathways. The miR-204-5p expression level was detected in HCC and in matched paraneoplastic liver from 95 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues by the real-time reverse transcription polymerized chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The association of miR-204-5p expression with clinicopathological features as well as the prognosis of HCC was examined. Public data portals including the Gene Expression Omnibus and The Cancer Genome Atlas were used to retrieve the HCC-related data in order to perform a comprehensive meta-analysis. Meanwhile, protein-protein interaction (PPI) and enrichment analyses were performed using predicted target genes. The relative expression of miR-204-5p was remarkably reduced in HCC than that in paraneoplastic hepatic tissues. In HCC, the miR-204-5p expression was downregulated in the metastasis, vasoinvasion, and advanced stage (III and IV) subgroups compared with their counterparts. Furthermore, the meta-analysis based on qRT-PCR data demonstrated that miR-204-5p was markedly downregulated in HCC with a standardized mean difference of -5.19 (P &lt; .001). However, no significant association was observed between miR-204-5p and survival outcomes. The potential target genes of miR-204-5p were significantly enriched in several pathways which might be associated with HCC, such as ""cell proliferation"" from GO terms and ""pathways in cancer"" from the KEGG analysis. A PPI network of miR-204-5p potential target genes identified prospective core genes potentially involved in the regulation of HCC oncogenesis and progression. Our findings suggested that miR-204-5p might act as a tumor-suppressive gene in the tumorigenesis and progression of HCC via vital signaling pathways and that miR-204-5p could be regarded as a protective factor in HCC.</abstracttext>]",[],[],['http://Insights.ovid.com/pubmed?pmid=28746200']

However, how the energy demand is met and the molecular drivers that coordinate an increase in cellular metabolic activity to drive epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), the first step of metastasis, remain unclear. Using different in vitro and in vivo EMT models with clinical patient's samples, we showed that EMT is an energy-demanding process fueled by glucose metabolism-derived adenosine triphosphate (ATP). We identified angiopoietin-like 4 (ANGPTL4) as a key player that coordinates an increase in cellular energy flux crucial for EMT via an ANGPTL4/14-3-3γ signaling axis. This augmented cellular metabolic activity enhanced metastasis. ANGPTL4 knockdown suppresses an adenylate energy charge elevation, delaying EMT. Using an in vivo dual-inducible EMT model, we found that ANGPTL4 deficiency reduces cancer metastasis to the lung and liver. Unbiased kinase inhibitor screens and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis revealed that ANGPTL4 regulates the expression of 14-3-3γ adaptor protein via the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase/AKT and mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathways that culminate to activation of transcription factors, CREB, cFOS and STAT3. Using a different mode of action, as compared with protein kinases, the ANGPTL4/14-3-3γ signaling axis consolidated cellular bioenergetics and stabilized critical EMT proteins to coordinate energy demand and enhanced EMT competency and metastasis, through interaction with specific phosphorylation signals on target proteins.Oncogene advance online publication, 24 July 2017; doi:10.1038/onc.2017.244.</abstracttext>]",[],[],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/onc.2017.244']

Though the literature describes a better prognosis in relation to the proportion of clear cells in the tumour when compared to the other variants, there is no general consensus in the management due to its rarity and unclear clinicopathological and prognostic factors. There is dearth of evidence with regard to the metastasizing nature of PCCCL and its management. In addition, the management of recurrent spinal tumours both primary and metastatic is not clear as the available evidence is mostly based on case reports. We describe an unusual presentation of PCCCL with solitary spinal metastasis and further complicated by tumour recurrence in a 71-year-old male. Such presentation has never been described before. He presented with low back pain and incomplete neurological deficits involving both lower limbs. On detailed evaluation, he was found to have a solitary metastasis at L3 vertebra secondary to PCCCL. He underwent radical excision of tumour and reconstruction for the solitary metastasis at L3 vertebral body and trans arterial chemo embolisation (TACE) for the hepatic lesion. Pt was asymptomatic until 9 months post operatively when he developed tumour recurrence at L3 vertebra. Patient subsequently underwent 2 stage palliative surgery followed by radiotherapy and chemotherapy. At his latest follow-up (1 year), the patient's overall general condition has improved with residual neurological deficits in the lower limb. PCCCL is a rare type of hepatocellular carcinoma which can present as ""solitary metastasis"" to the spine. Although the literature suggests a good prognosis for this histological type, this case did not have a good outcome. In addition to providing information for the management of similar cases in the future, this case report highlights that every patient has to be managed on a case-by-case basis.</abstracttext>]","[<div class=""keywords""><h4>KEYWORDS: </h4><p>Clear cell; carcinoma; liver; metastasis; recurrence; resection; spine</p></div>]",[],"['http://dx.doi.org/10.21037/jss.2017.06.06', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmid/28744515/']"

The therapeutic options are limited in this indication and dedicated prospective trials are difficult to achieve. Maintenance chemotherapy is an evolving concept in medical oncology whose goal is to prolong chemotherapy-induced response. The role of maintenance therapy has been demonstrated especially in many cancers but the results remain controversial in small cell cancer. We report a case of a 49-year-old woman admitted in our institution with biliary colic, postprandial bilious vomiting, right hypochondrial mass, and deteriorated general condition. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) revealed a mass of the gallbladder with lymphadenopathy in the hepatic hilum and multiple liver metastases. CT-guided biopsy was performed that showed small, round cells with high nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio, and frequent atypical mitosis, which is consistent with high-grade small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma. Tumor cells were positive for chromogranin A, synaptophysin, and CD56. Ki-67 shows a high proliferation rate with 90% tumor cell staining and the diagnosis of gallbladder SCC was confirmed. The treatment used a combination of carboplatin and etoposide, interrupted by the generalized discomfort and shortness of breath during the second course of the etoposide. Repeated CT scan showed a partial radiological response in the order of 35% and carboplatin monotherapy was maintained with good tolerance and stability of the disease until the 11th cure. Thrombocytopenia at 70,000 per mm<sup>3</sup> appeared, and its persistence forced the cessation of this treatment. Five months later, the disease progressed and second-line chemotherapy by irinotecan was given weekly.

In this study, metabolite identification of AZD8055 was performed using ultra high-performance liquid chromatography-ion trap mass spectrometry (UHPLC-IT-MS) through both in vitro and in vivo approaches using rat liver microsomes (RLMs) and rat plasma, urine and feces, respectively. A total of eight putative metabolites (five phase I and three phase II) were identified, and a tentative metabolic pathway was suggested for the first time. Considering the accurate mass and mass fragmentations of the detected metabolites, their plausible structures were suggested. Demethylation, hydroxylation, oxidation and morpholine ring opening were the major biotransformation processes for the phase-I metabolism, while phase-II metabolites were merely generated by the glucuronide conjugation reaction. The cumulative excretion of AZD8055 in urine and feces was 0.13% and 1.11% of the dose, respectively. When the semi-quantitative analysis of the metabolites was performed using UHPLC-MS/MS (ultra-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry) to evaluate the overall trend of metabolites formation and excretion, AZD8055 was excreted more in the form of the metabolites than itself and their formation was very fast. Therefore it was presumed that biotransformation was playing a crucial role in its elimination.

Our method is particularly useful for risk evaluation and recommendation of optimal subsequent treatments. We show that the proposed method has desirable theoretical properties, including asymptotic normality and the oracle property after variable selection. Numerical performance is evaluated on several simulation data sets and an application to hepatocellular carcinoma data.</abstracttext>]","[<div class=""keywords""><h4>KEYWORDS: </h4><p>Biomarker; Liver cancer; Risk prediction; Scoring system; Time-dependent AUC; Variable selection</p></div>]",[],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/biom.12750']

In the present work, it was determined in non-cancer and cancer cells the protein contents and kinetomics of (i) the cytosolic enzymes responsible for the NADPH production (i.e., Glc6PDH, 6PGDH, ME, IDH-1); and (ii) the two main enzymes responsible for NADPH/NADP<sup>+</sup> and GSH/GSSG recycling (GR, GPx-1) associated to oxidative stress management. With these data, kinetic models were built and further validated. Rat liver and hepatoma AS-30D cytosolic fractions exhibited greater Vmax for IDH-1 than for Glc6PDH and 6PGDH whereas human cancer cells and platelets showed greater Vmax for Glc6PDH than for 6PGDH and IDH-1. The ME activity was comparatively low in all cell types tested. The Km values for the respective specific substrates were all similar among the different cell types. Most activities were lower in AS-30D cells than in liver. In contrast, IDH-1, Glc6PDH and GR activities in human cancer cells were similar or greater to those of platelets, but GPx-1 activity was severely suppressed, despite showing similar GPx-1 protein content vs. platelets. Kinetic analysis and pathway modeling revealed a previously unveiled feedback IDH-1 regulation by GSH. The oxidative stress management in cancer cells (i) was mainly controlled by GPx-1 and the main NADPH provider was Glc6PDH; and (ii) modeling indicated that NADPH supply was not a controlling step. These data suggested that Glc6PDH and GPx-1 are adequate and promising targets for anti-cancer therapeutic intervention.</abstracttext>]","[<div class=""keywords""><h4>KEYWORDS: </h4><p>Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase; Glutathione peroxidase-1; Hydroperoxides; Isocitrate dehydrogenase-1; Kinetic modeling</p></div>]",[],['https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0891-5849(17)30700-1']

Our study aims to investigate the prognostic significance of DAPK1 in liver cancer in both mRNA and protein levels. The mRNA expression of DAPK1 was extracted from the Gene Expression Omnibus database in three independent liver cancer datasets while protein expression of DAPK1 was detected by immunohistochemistry in our Chinese liver cancer patient cohort. The associations between DAPK1 expression and clinical characteristics were tested. DAPK1 mRNA expression was down-regulated in liver cancer. Low levels of DAPK1 mRNA were associated with shorter survival in a liver cancer patient cohort (<i>n</i> = 115; <i>p</i> = 0.041), while negative staining of DAPK1 protein was significantly correlated with shorter time to progression (<i>p</i> = 0.002) and overall survival (<i>p</i> = 0.02). DAPK1 was an independent prognostic marker for both time to progression and overall survival by multivariate analysis. Liver cancer with the b-catenin mutation has a lower DAPK1 expression, suggesting that DAPK1 may be regulated under the b-catenin pathway. In addition, we also identified genes that are co-regulated with DAPK1. DAPK1 expression was positively correlated with IRF2, IL7R, PCOLCE and ZBTB16, and negatively correlated with SLC16A3 in both liver cancer datasets. Among these genes, PCOLCE and ZBTB16 were significantly down-regulated, while SLC16A3 was significantly upregulated in liver cancer.

The mGluR5 receptor has proved to be a key pharmacological target in conditions affecting the central nervous system (CNS) but its presence outside the CNS underscores its potential role in pathologies affecting peripheral organs such as the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and accessory digestive organs such as the tongue, liver and pancreas. Following identification of mGluR5s in the mouth, various studies have subsequently demonstrated its involvement in mechanical allodynia, inflammation, pain and oral cancer. mGluR5 expression has also been identified in gastroesophageal vagal pathways. Indeed, experimental and human studies have demonstrated that mGluR5 blockade reduces transient lower sphincter relaxation and reflux episodes. In the intestine, mGluR5s have been shown to be involved in the control of intestinal inﬂammation, visceral pain and the epithelial barrier function. In the liver, mGluR5s have a permissive role in the onset of ischemic injury in rat and mice hepatocytes.

Several HBV (sub)genotypes exist with different biology and geographical preponderances. While the future aim of HBV treatment remains virus eradication, current strategies of treatment aim to suppress the virus and prevent the progression of liver disease. Current strategies also involve identification of patients for treatment - those at risk of progressive liver disease. Identification of HBV genotype, HBV mutants and other predictive factors allow for tailored treatments, and also risk-surveillance pathways such as for hepatocellular cancer screening. In the future, these factors may allow stratification of not only treatment decisions, but also identify patients at risk of higher relapse rates when current therapies may be discontinued. Newer technologies, such as next generation sequencing to assess drug-resistant or immune escape variants and quasi-species heterogeneity in patients before and during treatment, may allow for more information-based treatment decisions between the clinician and the patient. This article serves to discuss how HBV (sub-)genotypes and genetic variants play a role in not only the disease course and outcomes, but also in how current treatment strategies can be influenced by them. Adopting a personalized approach per genotype may play a role in future strategies in combatting the disease.

It is recommended to apply a sheath liquid containing a matrix with a several μL/min flow rate at the end of the nanoLC column to ensure a larger co-eluted droplet for more reproducible sample spotting and avoid the laborious task of post-manual matrix spotting. In this study, to achieve a better nanoLC-MALDI performance on sample spotting, we first compared α-Cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (CHCA) solvent composition for efficiently concentrating nanoLC elutes on an anchor chip. The solvent composition of isopropanol (IPA): acetonitrile (ACN):acetone:0.1% Trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) (2:7:7:2) provided strong and homogeneous signals with higher peptide ion yields than the other solvent compositions. Then, nanoLC-MALDI-TOF/TOF was applied to study the impact of aflatoxin B1 on the liver proteome from diabetes mellitus type 1 mice. Aflatoxin B1 (AFB1), produced by Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus parasiticus is a carcinogen and a known causative agent of liver cancer. To evaluate the effects of long-term exposure to AFB1 on type 1 diabetes mellitus (TIDM), the livers of T1DM control mice and mice treated with AFB1 were analyzed using isotope-coded protein labeling (ICPL)-based quantitative proteomics. Our results showed that gluconeogenesis, lipid, and oxidative phosphorylation mechanisms, normally elevated in T1DM, were disordered following AFB1 treatment. In addition, major urinary protein 1 (MUP1), an indicator of increased insulin sensitivity, was significantly decreased in the T1DM/AFB1 group and may have resulted in higher blood glucose levels compared to the T1DM group. These results indicate that T1DM patients should avoid the AFB1 intake, as they could lead to increased blood glucose levels and disorders of energy-producing mechanisms.</abstracttext>]",[],[],"['http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0181423', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmid/28738076/']"

Herein, we report that ZNF687 was markedly upregulated in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell lines and HCC tissues, and was significantly correlated with relapse-free survival in HCC. ZNF687 overexpression greatly enhanced HCC cell capability for tumorsphere formation, invasion and chemoresistance in vitro, whereas inhibiting ZNF687 reduced these capabilities and inhibited HCC cell tumorigenic capability in vivo. Importantly, extreme limiting dilution analysis revealed that even 1 × 10<sup>2</sup> ZNF687-transduced cells could form tumors in vivo, indicating that ZNF687 contributes to HCC recurrence.

Surgical resection is the gold standard for treatment of hepatic metastasis but only a small percent of patients are traditional candidates based on disease extent and adequate size of the future liver remnant (FLR). Interventions such as portal vein embolization (PVE) and associating liver partition and portal vein ligation for staged hepatectomy (ALPPS) are performed to increase FLR for operative conversion. Limitations to PVE include intrahepatic disease progression, portal vascular invasion, and utilization with concurrent chemotherapy. ALPPS is associated with a high morbidly and mortality. Radiation lobectomy (RL) with yttrium-90 (Y-90) delivers transarterial ablative brachytherapy to the future hepatectomy site which generates FLR hypertrophy similar or greater than PVE. Early results indicate that RL is safe, effective, and may offer unique benefits by providing cytoreduction of hepatic metastases which extends FLR hypertrophy time and allows FLR surveillance to gauge disease biology. A retrospective analysis of four patients with ml-CRC treated with RL prior to hepatectomy was performed to evaluate initial safety, efficacy, FLR hypertrophy, and radiopathologic correlation. Adverse events after RL and hepatectomy were evaluated. Imaging findings were analyzed for efficacy defined as FLR hypertrophy and disease control. Radiopathologic correlation was performed after histologic analysis. RL was well tolerated without major adverse events or hepatic decompensation. FLR hypertrophy ranged from 24.9% to 119% at mean follow-up of three months. The majority of complications were related to surgical instrumentation of the FLR due to upstaging at time of surgery. Hepatectomy specimen histology demonstrated complete pathologic response in 50% of patients, 50% radiopathologic concordance rate, and no significant hepatic fibrosis. Initial experience with neoadjuvant RL for ml-CRC is safe and provides both durable disease control and FLR hypertrophy with concurrent chemotherapy.

TGFB signaling activated transcription of the Snail gene in liver tumors induced by HRAS<sup>G12V</sup> and shRNA agasint p53, and by activated RAS and TAZ. Knockdown of Snail reduced liver tumor formation in both tumor models. Ectopic expression of Snail restored liver tumorigenesis suppressed by disruption of TGFB signaling. In human HCC, Snail expression correlated with TGFB activation. Ectopic expression of Snail increased cellular proliferation, whereas Snail knockdown led to reduced proliferation in human HCC cells CONCLUSIONS: In analyses of transgenic mice, we found TGFB signaling to be required for formation of liver tumors upon expression of activated RAS and shRNA downregulating p53, and upon expression of activated RAS and TAZ.

Previous studies have reported the involvement of mitogeninducible gene 6 (MIG-6) as a negative regulator in tumor formation. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play crucial roles in the development of different types of cancer. However, the underlying mechanisms of miRNAs in HCC are poorly understood. This study was aimed to investigate the role of miR-374a in HCC and its role in regulation of expression of MIG-6. The results showed that MIG-6 overexpression significantly inhibited cell viability of HepG2 cells after 4 day of post-transfection. Moreover, MIG-6 was a direct target of miR-374a and the expression of MIG-6 was remarkably down-regulated by overexpression of miR-374a in HepG2 cells. Furthermore, we found that overexpression of miR-374a promoted cell viability, however, the protective effect was abolished by MIG-6 overexpression. Besides, overexpression of miR-374a activated EGFR and AKT/ERK signal pathways by regulation of MIG-6.

To date, no differentiation-inducing agents have been reported to exert a curative effect on solid tumors. Here our results demonstrated that OA restrained the proliferation and induced differentiation of hepatoma both in vitro and in vivo, via inducing a high PKM1 (pyruvate kinase M1)/PKM2 (pyruvate kinase M2) ratio. In addition, inhibited expression of polypyrimidine tract-binding protein by OA was in charge of the decrease of PKM2 and increase of PKM1. Further studies demonstrated that increased PKM1 translocated into the nucleus and bound with HNF-4α (hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 alpha) directly, promoting the transcription of HNF-4α-targeted genes. This work suggested that OA increased PKM1/PKM2 ratio, resulting in HNF-4α activation and hepatoma differentiation.

Near infrared (NIR) light induced release of entrapped Dox via PoP-mediated DOTAP photo-oxidation. The formulation was optimized to enable extremely rapid NIR light-triggered Dox release (i.e. in 15 seconds), while retaining reasonable serum stability. In vitro, cationic PoP liposomes readily bound both to MIA PaCa-2 human pancreatic cancer cells and human vascular endothelial cells. When administered intravenously, cationic PoP liposomes were cleared from circulation within minutes, with most accumulation in the liver and spleen. Fluorescence imaging revealed that some cationic PoP liposomes also localized at the tumor blood vessels. Compared to analogous neutral liposomes, strong tumor photo-ablation was induced with a single treatment of cationic PoP liposomes and laser irradiation (5 mg/kg Dox and 100 J/cm<sup>2</sup> NIR light). Unexpectedly, empty cationic PoP liposomes (lacking Dox) induced equally potent anti-tumor phototherapeutic effects as the drug loaded ones.

At six weeks post-irradiation, several crypts displayed signs of radiation-induced degeneration. The degenerating crypts were seen alongside crypts that appeared perfectly healthy. Crypt survival was reduced after the fourth fraction regardless of dose, while the number of macrophages increased. Angiogenesis was induced, likely as a compensatory mechanism for hypoxia. Four months post-irradiation, mice began to show radiation-induced symptoms, and histological examination revealed an extensive crypt loss and fibrosis.

Consenting patients with decompensated cirrhosis will be randomly allocated to education intervention or usual care treatment arms when they attend routine follow-up appointments. In the usual care arm, participants will be reviewed by their hepatologist according to the current model of care in the hepatology clinic. In the intervention arm, participants will be reviewed by a clinical pharmacist to receive the education and medication management intervention at baseline in addition to review by their hepatologist. Intervention participants will also receive three further educational contacts from the clinical pharmacist within the following 6-month period, in addition to routine hepatologist review that is scheduled within this time frame. All participants will be surveyed at baseline and follow-up (approximately 6 months post-enrollment). Validated questionnaire tools will be used to determine participant adherence, medication beliefs, illness perceptions, and quality of life.

To date, no systematic information is available about the substrate specificity of FSAP. Applying phage display and positional scanning substrate combinatorial library (PS-SCL) approaches we have characterised the specificity of FSAP towards small peptides. Results were evaluated in the context of known protein substrates as well as molecular modelling of the peptides in the active site of FSAP. The representative FSAP-cleaved sequence obtained from the phage display method was Val-Leu-Lys-Arg-Ser (P4-P1'). The sequence X-Lys/Arg-Nle-Lys/Arg (P4-P1) was derived from the PS-SCL method. These results show a predilection for cleavage at a cluster of basic amino acids on the nonprime side. Quenched fluorescent substrate (Ala-Lys-Nle-Arg-AMC) (amino methyl coumarin) and (Ala-Leu-Lys-Arg-AMC) had a higher selectivity for FSAP compared to other proteases from the hemostasis system. These substrates could be used to measure FSAP activity in a complex biological system such as plasma. In histone-treated plasma there was a specific activation of pro-FSAP as validated by the use of an FSAP inhibitory antibody, corn trypsin inhibitor to inhibit Factor XIIa and hirudin to inhibit thrombin, which may account for some of the haemostasis-related effects of histones. These results will aid the development of further selective FSAP activity probes as well as specific inhibitors that will help to increase the understanding of the functions of FSAP in vivo.</abstracttext>]","[<div class=""keywords""><h4>KEYWORDS: </h4><p>Serine protease; library; peptide substrates; phage display</p></div>]",[],['http://www.schattauer.de/index.php?id=1268&L=1&pii=th17-02-0081&no_cache=1']

A new paradigm of so-called ""pre-metastatic niches"" may sufficiently promote our knowledge regarding potential pathomechanisms, individual predisposition and prognosis in development and progression of the metastatic disease. However, the crucial question remains unaddressed, whether hypoxic pre-metastatic niches in BC are created by or prior to the tumour onset. So far, the current interpretation of the ""Seed and Soil"" theory of metastasis proposing that the pre-metastatic niches are formed by primary tumours which ""induce and guide"" the process is incomplete, since it does not provide satisfactory explanations towards several facts overviewed in the article.

We systematically analyzed MUC2 and IL-6 expression and determined the survival of cancer patients with high or low MUC2 and IL-6 expression using the Oncomine and PrognoScan databases, respectively. This analysis identified downregulation of MUC2 and overexpression of IL-6 in colon cancer but not in normal colon tissue, and this expression pattern was correlated with poor survival of colon cancer patients. We examined the effects of MUC2 on colon cancer metastasis and used vector-mediated application of short hairpin RNA (shRNA) to suppress MUC2 expression.

The interactions between ginsenosides and warfarin on thrombosis, pharmacokinetics, activities of coagulation factors and liver cytochrome P450 isomers are determined by using thrombosis analyzer, UPLC/MS/MS, ELISA and real-time PCR, respectively. The antagonism correlates well with the related pharmacokinetic interaction showing that the blood plateaus of warfarin reached by one-week warfarin administration are significantly reduced after three-week co-administration of warfarin with ginsenosides while 7-hydroxywarfarin is increased.

We found that PoPx showed growth inhibition on prostate cancer cells. Nuclei morphological and flow cytometer (FCM) analysis indicated that PoPx could induce prostate cancer apoptosis. Further investigation indicated that mitochondrial mediated intrinsic pathway is involved in the apoptosis. Exposure to PoPx led to loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential (Δym), accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Western blot analysis showed that PoPx could increase the expression ratio of Bax/Bcl2 and activation of apoptosis executor caspase 3. Wound healing assay and transwell migration and invasion assay implied that PoPx has the potential to inhibit migration and invasion, two critical steps in prostate cancer metastasis. Downregulation of MMP2/MMP9 and upregulation of TIMP2 showed accordance with the inhibition of migration and invasion.

Young adult specific-pathogen-free and germ-free mice were used to delineate the commensal microbiota's immunoregulatory effects on osteoblastogenesis, osteoclastogenesis, marrow T-cell hematopoiesis, and extra-skeletal endocrine organ function. We report the commensal microbiota has anti-anabolic effects suppressing osteoblastogenesis and pro-catabolic effects enhancing osteoclastogenesis, which drive bone loss in health. Suppression of Sp7(Osterix) and Igf1 in bone, and serum IGF1, in specific-pathogen-free mice suggest the commensal microbiota's anti-osteoblastic actions are mediated via local disruption of IGF1-signaling. Differences in the RANKL/OPG Axis in vivo, and RANKL-induced maturation of osteoclast-precursors in vitro, indicate the commensal microbiota induces sustained changes in RANKL-mediated osteoclastogenesis. Candidate mechanisms mediating commensal microbiota's pro-osteoclastic actions include altered marrow effector CD4<sup>+</sup>T-cells and a novel Gut-Liver-Bone Axis. The previously unidentified Gut-Liver-Bone Axis intriguingly implies the normal gut microbiota's osteoimmunomodulatory actions are partly mediated via immunostimulatory effects in the liver.

Several studies have indicated that lycopene exhibited anti-metastatic actions in vitro and in vivo. However, the role of NOX4 in the anti-metastatic action of lycopene remains unknown. Herein, we first confirmed the anti-metastatic effect of lycopene (0.1-5 μM) on human liver adenocarcinoma SK-Hep-1 cells. We showed that lycopene significantly inhibited NOX4 protein expression, with the strongest inhibition of 64.3 ± 10.2% (P &lt; 0.05) at 2.5 μM lycopene. Lycopene also significantly inhibited NOX4 mRNA expression, NOX activity, and intracellular ROS levels in SK-Hep-1 cells.

We found that TGF-β (5 ng/mL) significantly increased migration, invasion, and adhesion activity, the intracellular ROS level, matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9) and MMP-2 activities, the level of NOX4 protein expression, and NOX activity. All these TGF-β-induced effects were antagonized by the incubation of SK-Hep-1 cells with lycopene (2.5 μM). Using transient transfection of siRNA against NOX4, we found that the downregulation of NOX4 could mimic lycopene by inhibiting cell migration and the activities of MMP-9 and MMP-2 during the incubation with or without TGF-β on SK-Hep-1 cells.

Standardization of diagnosis and treatment in CLM comprised overall assessment of patients' condition and local tumor status based on multidisciplinary team collaboration and then institution of treatment strategy. Standardization of CLM diagnosis should be carried out by abdominal enhancement CT, or liver ultrasound to evaluate the hepatic metastasis. As for suspected CLM, serum AFP and liver MRI are recommended. When resectability is assessed, both surgery techniques (procedures, liver preservation, and resectable lesions outside of liver) and oncology items (synchronism, heterochronism, invasion and progression) must be considered.

The increased level of interleukin 6 stimulates the liver to synthesize and secrete C-reactive protein. As a risk factor, inflammation is an imbedded mechanism of developed cardiovascular diseases including coagulation, atherosclerosis, metabolic syndrome, insulin resistance, and diabetes mellitus. It is also associated with development of non-cardiovascular diseases such as psoriasis, depression, cancer, and renal diseases.

A valid mechanism-based prognostic biomarker is urgently needed. γ-hydroxy-1,N<sup>2</sup> -propanodeoxyguanosine (γ-OHPdG) is an endogenously formed mutagenic DNA adduct derived from lipid peroxidation (LPO). We examined the relationship of γ-OHPdG with hepatocarcinogenesis in two animal models and its potential role as a prognostic biomarker for recurrence in HCC patients. Bioassays were conducted in the Xeroderma pigmentosum group A knockout mice (Xpa<sup>-/-</sup> ), and the diethylnitrosamine (DEN)-injected mice, both prone to HCC development. γ-OHPdG levels in the livers of these animals were determined. The effects of antioxidant treatments on γ-OHPdG and hepatocarcinogenesis were examined. Using two independent sets of HCC specimens from patients, we examined the relationship between γ-OHPdG and survival or recurrence-free survival. γ-OHPdG levels in liver DNA showed an age-dependent increase and consistently correlated with HCC development in all three animal models. Theaphenon E treatment significantly decreased γ-OHPdG levels in the liver DNA of Xpa<sup>-/-</sup> mice, and remarkably reduced HCC incidence in these mice to 14% from 100% in the controls. It also effectively inhibited HCC development in the DEN-injected mice.

However, whether UA could inhibit STAT3 phosphorylation in hepatocellular carcinoma has not been reported. The inhibitory effects of UA on STAT3 phosphorylation, along with cell viability, migration, colony formation in vitro, as well as tumor growth in vivo were examined in human liver cancer cell lines. Our data showed that UA inhibited the P-STAT3 induced by interleukin-6 (IL-6) in Hep3B liver cancer cells which express very low basal level of P-STAT3. The constitutive STAT3 phosphorylation was also inhibited by UA in HEPG2, 7721 and Huh7 human liver cancer cell lines. UA decreased the expression of downstream target genes of STAT3, such as Bcl-2, Bcl-xl and survivin in general, with difference in these cell lines. UA also suppressed cell viability, cell migration and colony formation in liver cancer cells. Furthermore, UA suppressed STAT3 phosphorylation and HEPG2 tumor growth by oral daily treatment in vivo. UA, which exists widely in fruits and herbs, could inhibit STAT3 activation and the growth of human liver cancer cells in vitro and in vivo.

Among the various types of RNA editing, adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing is the most frequent type of RNA editing in mammals. Adenosine deaminases acting on RNA (ADAR) enzymes, ADAR1 and ADAR2, convert adenosines in double-stranded RNA structures into inosines by hydrolytic deamination. Inosine forms a base pair with cytidine as if it were guanosine; therefore, the conversion may affect the amino acid sequence, splicing, microRNA targeting, and miRNA maturation. It became apparent that disrupted RNA editing or abnormal ADAR expression is associated with several diseases including cancer, neurological disorders, metabolic diseases, viral infections, and autoimmune disorders. The biological significance of RNA editing in pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics (PK/PD)-related genes is starting to be demonstrated.

Although rare (&lt;5%), clinical response to anti-PD-1 antibody may be preceded by ""pseudoprogression"" -- increase in the size and number of tumor lesions before actual tumor shrinkage. We report a case of pseudoprogression followed by an excellent response in an HCC patient treated with nivolumab and review the literature for ongoing trials of immune checkpoint blockade in HCC. The pseudoprogression in our case is supported by increase in both tumor size and alpha-fetoprotein after four treatments with nivolumab; however, regression of tumor size and normalization of alpha-fetoprotein occurred after subsequent treatments. To our knowledge, there are no reports of pseudoprogression in HCC although pseudoprogression has been well described in melanoma.</abstracttext>]",[],[],['http://www.discoverymedicine.com/Hirva-Mamdani/2017/05/anti-pd-1-therapy-in-hepatocellular-carcinoma-case-report-and-review/']

Our previous study demonstrated an increased expression of aspartate β-hydroxylase (ASPH) in HCC tissues, which was associated with tumor invasiveness and a worse prognosis. Currently, we unexpectedly observed the presence of ASPH in purified mitochondrial protein fraction. In addition, immunostaining of both exogenously and endogenously expressed ASPH showed a colocalization with mitochondrial biomarkers. This study aimed to investigate whether the mitochondrial ASPH is involved in mitochondrial malfunction in HCC. Our results showed that ASPH overexpression in HCC tissues was correlated with decreased copy numbers of displacement loop (D-loop) and NADH dehydrogenase subunit 1 (ND-1) and enhanced D-loop mutation, suggesting the disrupted mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) stability. The reduced mtDNA copy numbers were associated with aggressive clinicopathological features of HCC. The loss of mtDNA integrity induced by enforced expression of ASPH was accompanied with mitochondrial dysfunction, which was characterized by the aberrant mitochondrial membrane potential, decreased ATP generation and enhanced reactive oxygen species. In contrast, knocking down ASPH by siRNA in HCC cell lines showed the opposite impact on mtDNA integrity and function. Mass spectrometry and co-immunoprecipitation further identified that ASPH interacted with histone H2A member X (H2AX). ASPH overexpression diminished the interaction between H2AX and mitochondrial transcription factor A (mtTFA), an important DNA-binding protein for mtDNA replication, which then reduced the binding of mtTFA to D-loop region. Collectively, our results demonstrate that ASPH overexpression disrupts the mtDNA integrity through H2AX-mtTFA signal, thereby affecting mitochondrial functions in HCC.</abstracttext>]",[],[],"['http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/oncsis.2017.64', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmid/28714949/']"

The transcriptional regulator Yes-associated protein 1 (YAP) is a key regulator of liver size, development and function. We now show that YAP can also suppress gluconeogenic gene expression. Yap deletion in primary hepatocytes potentiates the gluconeogenic gene response to glucagon and dexamethasone, whereas constitutively active YAP suppresses it. The effects of YAP are mediated by the transcriptional coactivator peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1 (PGC1α). YAP inhibits the ability of PGC1α to bind to and activate transcription from the promoters of its gluconeogenic targets and the effects of YAP are blunted upon knockdown of PGC1α. In vivo, constitutively active YAP lowers plasma glucose levels and increases liver size. YAP therefore appears to reprogram cellular metabolism, diverting substrates away from the energy consuming process of gluconeogenesis, and towards the anabolic process of growth.

Areas covered: Application of next-generation sequencing (NGS), including targeted NGS (tNGS), whole-exome sequencing (WES), whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and RNA sequencing (RNAseq), on clinical samples from patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) could aid in comprehending tumorigenesis, genetic and genomic heterogeneity, as well as developing molecular classifications for specialized targeted therapy. Expert commentary: Despite the many overenthusiastic original and opinion reports, we have critically reviewed available NGS studies, with focus on the challenges to achieve clinical implications. Based on the recommendations for valid identification of clinically crucial genomic alterations (GAs) by NGS, we propose NGS integration into appropriately designed clinical trials.

On the other hand, liver-specific Irs2-knockout (LIrs2KO) mice showed a similar pattern of HCC development to the DEN-treated control wild-type mice. Based on the knowledge that Wnt/β-catenin signaling is activated in HCC, we focused on Wnt/β-catenin signaling and demonstrated that Irs1 expression was induced by Wnt3a stimulation in the primary hepatocytes, associated with insulin-stimulated Akt activation.

Using a circRNA microarray, we identified 226 differentially expressed circRNAs, of which 189 were significantly upregulated and 37 were downregulated. High expression of circRNA_100338, one of the upregulated circRNAs in HCC, is closely correlated with a low cumulative survival rate and metastatic progression in HCC patients with hepatitis B.

In this study, we aimed to investigate the expression and function of miR-136 in colon cancer and the potential underlying mechanism. Here, we found that miR-136 was decreased in colon cancer cell lines and tissues. Overexpression of miR-136 inhibited the proliferation and invasion in SW480 and HCT116 cell lines while suppression of miR-136 exhibited the opposite effect. Liver receptor homolog-1 (LRH-1) was identified as a direct target gene of miR-136. Notably, miR-136 overexpression suppressed LRH-1 expression as well as Wnt signaling in SW480 and HCT116 cell lines.

Moreover, overexpression of LRH-1 partially reversed the miR-136-induced antitumor effect in SW480 and HCT116 cell lines. Taken together, these findings suggest that miR-136 functions as a negative regulator in colon cancer progression by targeting LRH-1 and that miR-136 downregulation contributes to high expression of LRH-1 and aberrant activation of Wnt signaling, leaving open the possibility that miR-136 may serve as a potential therapeutic target for colon cancer.</abstracttext>]","[<div class=""keywords""><h4>KEYWORDS: </h4><p>Colon cancer; LRH-1; Wnt; miR-136</p></div>]",[],['https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0378-1119(17)30541-3']

The rats were divided into three groups according to injection: anti-MG1-coupled HNPs (n = 6), HNPs only (n = 6), and cells only (control group, n = 7). Voxel-wise R2 and R2* magnetic resonance (MR) imaging measurements were obtained before, immediately after, and 24 hours after injection. PTA was then performed with a fiber-coupled near-infrared (808 nm) diode laser with laser power of 0.56 W/cm<sup>2</sup> for 3 minutes, while temperature changes were measured. Tumors were assessed for necrosis with hematoxylin-eosin staining. Organs were analyzed with inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry to assess biodistribution. Therapeutic efficacy and tumor necrosis area were compared by using a one-way analysis of variance with post hoc analysis for statistically significant differences. Results The coupling efficiency was 22 μg/mg (55%). Significant differences were found between preinfusion and 24-hour postinfusion measurements of both T2 (repeated measures analysis of variance, P = .025) and T2* (P &lt; .001). Significant differences also existed for T2* measurements between the anti-MG1 HNP and HNP-only groups (P = .034). Mean temperature ± standard deviation with PTA in the anti-MG1-coated HNP, HNP, and control groups was 50.2°C ± 7.8, 51°C ± 4.4, and 39.5°C ± 2.0, respectively. Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry revealed significant tumor targeting and splenic sequestration. Mean percentages of tumor necrosis in the anti-MG1-coated HNP, HNP, and control groups were 38% ± 29, 14% ± 17, and 7% ± 8, respectively (P = .043). Conclusion Targeted monoclonal antibody-conjugated HNPs can serve as a catalyst for photothermal ablation of colorectal liver metastases by increasing ablation zones. <sup>©</sup> RSNA, 2017.</abstracttext>]",[],[],['http://pubs.rsna.org/doi/10.1148/radiol.2017161497?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&rfr_dat=cr_pub%3dpubmed']

Potential clues are that the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum selectively absorbs vitamin A from the host and depends on it for its biological activities; secondly, alterations in vitamin A (retinoid) metabolism have been implicated in many forms of cancer, including BL. The first author has proposed that the merozoite-stage malaria parasite, emerging from the liver, uses its absorbed vitamin A as a cell membrane destabilizer to invade the red blood cells, causing anemia and other signs and symptoms of the disease as manifestations of an endogenous form of hypervitaminosis A (Mawson AR, Path Global Health 2013;107(3):122-9). Repeated episodes of malaria would therefore be expected to expose the tissues of affected individuals to potentially toxic doses of vitamin A. It is proposed that such episodes activate latent EBV infection, which in turn activates retinoid-responsive genes. Expression of these genes enhances viral replication and induces germinal center (GC) B cell expansion, activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) expression, and c-myc translocation, which in turn predisposes to BL. Thus, an endogenous form of retinoid toxicity related to malaria infection may be the common factor linking frequent malaria, EBV infection and BL, whereby prolonged exposure of lymphatic tissues to high concentrations of retinoids may combine to induce B-cell translocation and increase the risk of Burkitt's lymphoma.</abstracttext>]","[<div class=""keywords""><h4>KEYWORDS: </h4><p>Burkitt's lymphoma; Epstein-Barr virus; Plasmodium falciparum; malaria; pathogenesis; retinoids</p></div>]",[],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ijc.30885']

A previous 28-day oral feeding study with rats revealed that the endogenous antioxidant protein DJ-1 was strongly deregulated at the protein level in kidney, liver, and testis of the experimental animals that had been treated either with 3-MCPD, 2-MCPD or their dipalmitate esters.

Irreversible oxidation of DJ-1 is associated with a number of oxidative stress-related diseases such as Parkinson, cancer, and type II diabetes.

Here, we investigate the roles of autophagy and metabolism in PaCa cell adaptation to environmental stresses, amino acid (AA) depletion and hypoxia. It is known that in healthy cells, basal autophagy is at a low level, but it is greatly activated by environmental stresses. By contrast, we find that in PaCa cells basal autophagic activity is relatively high, but AA depletion and hypoxia activate autophagy only weakly or not at all, due to their failure to inhibit mTOR. Basal, but not stress-induced, autophagy is necessary for PaCa cell proliferation; and AA supply is even more critical to maintain PaCa cell growth. To gain insight into the underlying mechanisms, we analyzed the effects of autophagy inhibition and AA depletion on PaCa cell metabolism. PaCa cells display mixed oxidative/glycolytic metabolism, with oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) predominant. Both autophagy inhibition and AA depletion dramatically decreased OXPHOS; furthermore, pharmacologic inhibitors of OXPHOS suppressed PaCa cell proliferation. The data indicate that maintaining OXPHOS is a key mechanism through which autophagy and AA supply support PaCa cell growth. We find that the expression of oncogenic Kras markedly promotes basal autophagy and stimulates OXPHOS through autophagy-dependent mechanism. The results suggest that approaches aimed to suppress OXPHOS, particularly through limiting AA supply, could be beneficial in treating PDAC.</abstracttext>]","[<div class=""keywords""><h4>KEYWORDS: </h4><p>autophagy; cell growth; cell metabolism; mitochondria; pancreatic cancer</p></div>]",[],['http://ajpgi.physiology.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=reprint&pmid=28705806']

This study proposes an automatic computational method to objectively identify the optimal reference frame for distinguishing and hence delineating an FLL, by statistically analyzing the temporal intensity variation across the spatially discretized ultrasonographic image. Level of confidence and clinical value of the proposed method were quantitatively evaluated on retrospective multi-institutional data (n = 64) and compared with expert interpretations. Results support the proposed method for facilitating easier, quicker and reproducible assessment of FLLs, further increasing the radiologists' confidence in diagnostic decisions.

FAHFAs attracted increasing attention because of their critical physiological function. However, accurate quantitation of FAHFAs is still a challenge due to their high structure similarity and low abundance in biological samples. Herein, we developed a highly sensitive method for the determination of 16 FAHFAs (PAHSAs, OAHSAs, SAHSAs and POHSAs) in biological samples by coupling strong anion exchange solid phase extraction (SAX-SPE) with chemical labeling assisted ultra-high performance liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (SAX-SPE-CL-UHPLC/MS). In the developed method, SAX-SPE was employed to selectively enrich and purify FAHFAs from biological samples. And then a pair of isotope labeling reagents, 2-dimethylaminoethylamine (DMED) and d<sub>4</sub>-DMED were used to label the purified samples and standard FAHFAs, respectively. The labeled samples were mixed and further subjected to UHPLC/MS analysis. Our results demonstrated that the detection sensitivities of FAHFAs increased by 7-72 folds upon DMED labeling and the limits of detections (LODs) of labeled FAHFAs ranged from 0.01 to 0.14pg. Moreover, a good separation of FAHFAs isomers was achieved on C18 column in a UHPLC system and all FAHFAs could be analyzed in 20min with sharp peak shape. The established method provided substantial sensitivity, high specificity, and broad linear dynamic range (3 orders of magnitude). Using this method, we successfully measured the contents and distribution of FAHFAs in rat white adipose, lung, kidney, thymus, liver and heart tissues. The results showed that 7 FAHFAs (13-, 12-, 9-, 5-PAHSA, 13-, 12- and 9-SAHSA) were observed in different tissues of rat. In addition, we successfully detected the above 7 FAHFAs in human serum samples; and among the 7 FAHFAs, 13-, 9-PAHSA, 13- and 12-SAHSA were found remarkably decreased in human breast cancer serum. The proposed method could be successfully applied for the detection of FAHFAs in various biological samples, which will facilitate the understanding of the physiological functions of FAHFAs.</abstracttext>]","[<div class=""keywords""><h4>KEYWORDS: </h4><p>Branched fatty acid esters of hydroxy fatty acids; Chemical labeling; Mass spectrometry analysis; Solid phase extraction</p></div>]",[],['https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1570-0232(17)30402-6']

There is evidence that deamination of DNA bases induces mutations, but no study has directly linked Hx accumulation to mutagenesis and strand-specific mutations yet in human cells. Using a site-specific mutagenesis approach, we report the first direct evidence of mutation potential and pattern of Hx in live human cells. We investigated Hx-induced mutations in human nonmalignant HEK293 and cancer HCT116 cell lines and found that Hx is mutagenic in both HEK293 and HCT116 cell lines. There is a strand bias for Hx-mediated mutations in both the cell lines; the Hx in lagging strand is more mutagenic than in leading strand. There is also some difference in cell types regarding the strand bias for mutation types; HEK293 cells showed largely deletion (&gt;80%) mutations in both leading and lagging strand and the rest were insertions and A:T→G:C transition mutations in leading and lagging strands, respectively, whereas in HCT116 cells we observed 60% A:T→G:C transition mutations in the leading strand and 100% deletions in the lagging strand. Overall, Hx is a highly mutagenic lesion capable of generating A:T→G:C transitions and large deletions with a significant variation in leading and lagging strands in human cells. In recent meta-analysis study A→G (T→C) mutations were found to be a prominent signature in a variety of cancers, including a majority types that are induced by inflammation. The deletions are known to be a major cause of copy-number variations or CNVs, which is a major underlying cause of many human diseases including mental illness, developmental disorders and cancer.

Obesity has been associated with chronic disease development, such as certain types of cancer, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and liver diseases.

The intestinal microbiota is composed of a diverse population of obligate and facultative anaerobic microorganisms, and these organisms carry out a broad range of metabolic activities. Obesity has been linked to changes in the intestinal microbiota, but the composition of the bacterial populations in lean and obese Zucker rats has not been carefully studied. Therefore, the objective of this study was to determine the effects of obesity on the gut microbiota in this model. Lean and obese female Zucker rats (n = 16) were fed an AIN-93G-like diet for 8 weeks.

In this study, we applied transcriptomics to investigate the progress of in vitro hepatic differentiation of hPSCs at the developmental stages, definitive endoderm, hepatoblasts, early hPSC-HEP, and mature hPSC-HEP, to identify functional targets that enhance efficient hepatocyte differentiation.

Although detachment from the extracellular matrix is a strong source of metabolic stress, which induces anoikis, CTCs can survive. Recently, the tumor suppressor liver kinase B1 (LKB1) has gained attention for its role as a proto-oncogene in restoring the correct ATP/AMP ratio during metabolic stress. The aim of this study was to assess LKB1 expression in epithelial-negative CTCs isolated from metastatic breast cancer patients and to characterize its possible association with EMT and stemness features. Transcriptome analysis of EpCAM negative CTCs indicated that over 25% of patients showed enhanced LKB1 levels, whilst almost 20% of patients had enhanced levels of an EMT transcription factor known as ZEB1. Transcriptome and immuno-fluorescence analyses showed that patients with enhanced LKB1 were correspondingly ZEB1-negative, suggesting complementary activity for the two proteins. Only ZEB1 was significantly associated with cancer stem cell (CSC) markers. Neither LKB1 nor ZEB1 upregulation showed a correlation with clinical outcome, while enhanced levels of stemness associated CD44 correlated with a lower progression free- and overall-survival. Ex-vivo models showed that MDA-MB-231, a mesenchymal tumor cell line, grew in suspension only if LKB1 was upregulated, but the MCF-7 epithelial cell line lost its ability to generate spheroids and colonies when LKB1 was inhibited, supporting the idea that LKB1 might be necessary for CTCs to overcome the absence of the extracellular matrix during the early phases of intravasation. If these preliminary results are confirmed, LKB1 will become a novel therapeutic target for eradicating metastasis-initiating CTCs from primary breast cancer patients.

Heat-treated residual HCC cells were cultured on tailorable 3D gel with different matrix stiffness, simulating the changed physical environment after thermal ablation, and then the mechanical alterations of matrix stiffness on cell phenotypes were explored. Increased stiffness was found to significantly promote the proliferation of the heat-treated residual HCC cells when the cells were cultured on stiffer versus soft supports, which was associated with stiffness-dependent regulation of ERK phosphorylation. Heat-exposed HCC cells cultured on stiffer supports showed enhanced motility. More importantly, vitamin K1 reduced stiffness-dependent residual HCC cell proliferation by inhibiting ERK phosphorylation and suppressed the in vivo tumor growth, which was further enhanced by combining with sorafenib. Increased matrix stiffness promotes the progression of heat-treated residual HCC cells, proposing a new mechanism of an altered biomechanical environment after thermal ablation accelerates HCC development.

We performed this study to elucidate the molecular mechanisms responsible for evading cell death in colorectal CSCs mediated by anticancer agents. During the cell cycle arrest caused by anticancer agents, we found that c-Myc expression was substantially decreased in colorectal CSCs. The c-Myc expression alterations were mediated by upregulation of F-box/WD repeat-containing protein 7 (FBXW7), as evidenced through FBXW7-small interfering RNA knockdown experiments that resulted in enhanced cell sensitivity to anticancer agents. Upregulation of FBXW7 following drug treatment was not evident in commercially available cancer cell lines. Colorectal CSCs were induced to differentiation by Matrigel and fetal bovine serum. Differentiated CSCs treated with anticancer agents did not show upregulation of FBXW7 and were more sensitive to irinotecan (CPT-11), highlighting the potential CSC-specific nature of our data. The FBXW7 over-expression was further validated in resected liver metastatic sites in CRC patients after chemotherapy. In conclusion, our study revealed that a CSC-specific FBXW7-regulatory mechanism is strongly associated with resistance to chemotherapeutic agents.

Radiation-induced toxicities in nontumorous liver tissues are associated with the development of numerous symptoms that may limit the course of therapy or have serious chronic side effects, including late fibrosis. Although the clinical characteristics of RILD patients have been relatively well described, the understanding of RILD pathogenesis has been hampered by a lack of reliable animal models for RILD. Despite efforts to develop suitable experimental animal models for RILD, current animal models rarely present hepatic veno-occlusive disease, the pathological hallmark of human RILD patients, resulting in highly variable results in RILD-related studies. Therefore, we introduce the concept and clinical characteristics of RILD and propose a feasible explanation for RILD pathogenesis. In addition, currently available animal models of RILD are reviewed, focusing on similarities with human RILD and clues to understanding the mechanisms of RILD progression. Based on these findings from RILD research, we present potential therapeutic strategies for RILD and prospects for future RILD studies.

MiR-30a is downregulated in a variety of cancers and acts as a tumor suppressing gene. However, the molecular mechanisms of miRNA-30a in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are still unclear. Hereby, in this study, we detected that miR-30a expression was significantly down-regulated in both HCC tissues compared with adjacent non-cancerous liver tissues, and we also observed that miR-30a expression was lower in HCC cell lines than that of normal controls. By overexpression of miRNA-30a, we evaluated cell growth with CCK-8 assay and cell apoptosis by flow cytometry. The function of miR-30a on cellular migration in HCC cells was assessed. The potential target genes of miR-30a were analyzed with luciferase activity assay. Our data displayed that miR-30a mimic markedly inhibited HCC cell growth, induced cell apoptosis, and upregulated the expression of apoptotic proteins in HepG2 and MHCC976L cells. We also found that upregulation of miR-30a significantly inhibited HCC cells migration and invasion. Bioinformatics analysis revealed K-Ras was a regulative target gene of miR-30a, and further dual luciferase reporter assay showed that miR-30a directly binds to the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) of K-Ras mRNA. Furthermore, we found that in HepG2 and MHCC97L cancer cells, miR-30a overexpression completely blocked the K-Ras/c-Raf/MEK/ERK pathway activation. Overall, these findings demonstrated that miR-30a might play a certain role in the cell growth, apoptosis and metastasis of HCC cells, partially via regulating K-Ras/c-Raf/MEK/ERK signaling pathway, potentially, it is therefore a candidate targeting biomarker for HCC therapy.</abstracttext>]","[<div class=""keywords""><h4>KEYWORDS: </h4><p>Growth; Hepatocellular carcinoma; K-Ras/c-Raf/MEK/ERK signal pathways; Metastasis; MiR-30a</p></div>]",[],['https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0753-3322(17)31517-2']

The expression of SMURF1 was detected in 68 cases of GC and corresponding tumor-adjacent specimens. Our results revealed that SMURF1 was prominently overexpressed in GC specimens compared to corresponding tumor-adjacent tissues. Furthermore, increased levels of SMURF1 mRNA were also observed in GC cell lines. Clinicopathological detection ascertained that SMURF1-positive expression was associated with large tumor size, more lymph nodes and distant metastasis as well as advanced tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) stage of GC. Notably, GC patients with SMURF1 positive‑expressing tumors exhibited a significant decreased survival. Further experiments illustrated that SMURF1 knockdown significantly inhibited proliferation, migration and invasion of MGC-803 cells, while SMURF1 overexpression prominently promoted these behaviors in SGC-7901 cells. In vivo studies revealed that SMURF1 knockdown markedly inhibited tumor growth and liver metastasis of GC.

In the present study, we found that GCDA can induce the chemoresistance of human liver cancer cells and specific depletion of Bcl-2 by RNA interference blocks GCDA-stimulated chemoresistance, which indicate the pivotal role of Bcl-2 in such process. Mechanistically, GCDA simultaneously stimulates phosphorylation of Bcl-2 at Ser70 site and activates extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2), and inhibition of ERK1/2 by PD98059 (MAPK/ERK1/2 inhibitor) or siRNA (targeting ERK1/2) suppresses GCDA-stimulated phosphorylation of Bcl-2 and significantly attenuates the survival and chemoresistance induced by GCDA in liver cancer cells.

Arising from bone marrow stem cell lineage megakaryocytes, anucleate platelets can influence inflammation and immune regulation. Biophysically, platelets are optimized due to size and discoid morphology to distribute near vessel walls, monitor vascular integrity, and initiate quick responses to vascular lesions. Adhesion receptors linked to a highly reactive filopodia-generating cytoskeleton maximizes their vascular surface contact allowing rapid response capabilities. Functionally, platelets normally initiate rapid clotting, vasoconstriction, inflammation, and wound biology that leads to sterilization, tissue repair, and resolution. Platelets also are among the first to sense, phagocytize, decorate, or react to pathogens in the circulation. These platelet first responder properties are commandeered during chronic inflammation, cancer progression, and metastasis. Leaky or inflammatory reaction blood vessel genesis during carcinogenesis provides opportunities for platelet invasion into tumors. Cancer is thought of as a non-healing or chronic wound that can be actively aided by platelet mitogenic properties to stimulate tumor growth. This growth ultimately outstrips circulatory support leads to angiogenesis and intravasation of tumor cells into the blood stream. Circulating tumor cells reengage additional platelets, which facilitates tumor cell adhesion, arrest and extravasation, and metastasis. This process, along with the hypercoagulable states associated with malignancy, is amplified by IL6 production in tumors that stimulate liver thrombopoietin production and elevates circulating platelet numbers by thrombopoiesis in the bone marrow. These complex interactions and the ""first responder"" role of platelets during diverse physiologic stresses provide a useful therapeutic target that deserves further exploration.</abstracttext>]","[<div class=""keywords""><h4>KEYWORDS: </h4><p>CTC; Extravasation; Metastasis; Platelet; TCIPA; Thrombosis</p></div>]",[],['https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10555-017-9682-0']

On multivariable analysis, pancreatic NET, primary tumor lymph node metastasis, and a microscopic positive surgical margin were independent risk factors for early intrahepatic recurrence. While recurrence patterns and treatments were comparable among patients with early and late recurrences, early recurrence was associated with worse disease-specific survival than late recurrences (10-year NELM-specific survival, 44.5 vs 75.8%, p &lt; 0.001).

Based on the expression of lncRNA, we developed a risk score model, which was evaluated by survival analysis and ROC (receiver operating characteristic) curve. Enrichment analysis was performed to predict the possible role of the identified lncRNA in HCC prognosis.</abstracttext>, <abstracttext label=""RESULTS"" nlmcategory=""RESULTS"">Four lncRNAs (<i>RP11-322E11.5</i>, <i>RP11-150O12.3</i>, <i>AC093609.1</i>, <i>CTC-297N7.9</i>) were found to be significantly and independently associated with survival of HCC patients. We used these four lncRNAs to construct a risk score model, which exhibited a strong ability to distinguish patients with significantly different prognosis (HR = 2.718, 95% CI [2.103-3.514], <i>p</i> = 2.32e-14). Similar results were observed in the subsequent stratification survival analysis for HBV infection status and pathological stage. The ROC curve also implied our risk score as a good indicator for 5-year survival prediction. Furthermore, enrichment analysis revealed that the four signature lncRNAs may be involved in multiple pathways related to tumorigenesis and prognosis.</abstracttext>, <abstracttext label=""DISCUSSION"" nlmcategory=""CONCLUSIONS"">Our study recognized four lncRNAs to be significantly associated with prognosis of liver cancer, and could provide novel insights into the potential mechanisms of HCC progression.
