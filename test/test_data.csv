Yet, the weak and narrow absorption of lanthanide ions poses a fundamental limit of UCNPs to withhold their brightness, creating a long-standing hurdle for the field. Dye-sensitized UCNPs are emerging to address this performance-limiting problem, yielding up to thousands-fold brighter luminescence than conventional UCNPs without dye sensitization. In their configuration, organic dyes with spectrally broad and intense absorption are anchored to the surface of UCNPs to harvest the excitation light energy, which is then transferred via Förster and/or Dexter mechanisms across the organic/inorganic interface to the lanthanides incorporated in UCNPs (with or devoid of a shell) to empower efficient upconversion. This tutorial review highlights recent progress in the development of dye sensitized UCNPs, with an emphasis on the theory of energy transfer, the geometric classification of the dye sensitized core and core/shell nanocrystals, and their emerging photonic and biophotonic applications. Opportunities and challenges offered by dye sensitized UCNPs are also discussed.</abstracttext>]",['http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c7cs00053g']

The prevalence of PAD is higher in patients receiving haemodialysis therapy. For early assessment of arterial occlusion using bilateral photoplethysmography (PPG), such as changes in pulse transit time and pulse shape, bilateral timing differences could be used to identify the risk level of PAD. Hence, the authors propose a discrete fractional-order integrator to calculate the bilateral area under the systolic peak (AUSP). These indices indicated the differences in both rise-timing and amplitudes of PPG signals. The dexter and sinister AUSP ratios were preliminarily used to separate the normal condition from low/high risk of PAD. Then, transition probability-based decision-making model was employed to evaluate the risk levels. The joint probability could be specified as a critical threshold, &lt; 0.81, to identify the true positive for screening low or high risk level of PAD, referring to the patients' health records. In contrast to the bilateral timing differences and traditional methods, the proposed model showed better efficiency in PAD assessments and provided a promising strategy to be implemented in an embedded system.</abstracttext>]",[]

The achievable concentration of ribavirin within hepatocytes is likely to be an important determinant of therapeutic outcome. In vitro expression levels of equilibrative nucleoside transporter 1 (ENT1) has been shown to be a predictor of treatment response in patients receiving nucleoside-based chemotherapeutic agents. We therefore investigated whether a similar relationship existed between ENT1 expression and ribavirin uptake in freshly isolated primary hepatocytes. Methods Primary hepatocytes were cultured on collagen-coated plates and exposed to ribavirin. Parallel samples were taken for high-performance liquid chromatography to assess ribavirin uptake and for quantitative polymerase chain reaction to evaluate ENT1 expression. Similar assays were performed on the human hepatoma cell line (Huh7). ENT1 gene sequence was analysed by cloning of polymerase chain reaction amplified complementary DNA followed by direct sequencing. Results There was a strong direct correlation between expression of ENT1 in primary hepatocytes and ribavirin uptake at 24 hr. Huh7 cells expressed ENT1 at similar levels to the majority of primary hepatocytes, but did not take up ribavirin. Sequencing revealed that ENT1 in Huh7 cells is wild type. Conclusions In this study, we clearly demonstrate that ribavirin uptake in primary human hepatocytes is variable and correlates with ENT1 expression. This variation in ENT1 expression may account for differences in response rate in patients receiving ribavirin-based anti-hepatitis C virus therapy.</abstracttext>]",['http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/2040206616686894?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&rfr_dat=cr_pub%3dpubmed']

However, there is a paucity in studies examining the effect of AgNP on the resident immune cells of the brain, microglia. Given microglia are implicated in neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's disease (PD), it is important to examine how AgNPs affect microglial inflammation to fully assess AgNP neurotoxicity. In addition, understanding AgNP processing by microglia will allow better prediction of their long term bioreactivity. In the present study, the in vitro uptake and intracellular transformation of citrate-capped AgNPs by microglia, as well as their effects on microglial inflammation and related neurotoxicity were examined. Analytical microscopy demonstrated internalization and dissolution of AgNPs within microglia and formation of non-reactive silver sulphide (Ag<sub>2</sub>S) on the surface of AgNPs. Furthermore, AgNP-treatment up-regulated microglial expression of the hydrogen sulphide (H<sub>2</sub>S)-synthesizing enzyme cystathionine-γ-lyase (CSE). In addition, AgNPs showed significant anti-inflammatory effects, reducing lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated ROS, nitric oxide and TNFα production, which translated into reduced microglial toxicity towards dopaminergic neurons. Hence, the present results indicate that intracellular Ag<sub>2</sub>S formation, resulting from CSE-mediated H<sub>2</sub>S production in microglia, sequesters Ag<sup>+</sup> ions released from AgNPs, significantly limiting their toxicity, concomitantly reducing microglial inflammation and related neurotoxicity.</abstracttext>]","['http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/srep42871', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmid/28251989/']"

The cause of ADHD and PD remains unknown, but there is increasing evidence that both seem to result from a complicated interplay of genetic and environmental factors affecting numerous cellular processes and brain regions. To explore the possibility of common genetic pathways within the respective pathophysiologies, nine ADHD candidate single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in seven genes were tested for association with PD in 5333 cases and 12,019 healthy controls: one variant, respectively, in the genes coding for synaptosomal-associated protein 25 k (SNAP25), the dopamine (DA) transporter (SLC6A3; DAT1), DA receptor D4 (DRD4), serotonin receptor 1B (HTR1B), tryptophan hydroxylase 2 (TPH2), the norepinephrine transporter SLC6A2 and three SNPs in cadherin 13 (CDH13). Information was extracted from a recent meta-analysis of five genome-wide association studies, in which 7,689,524 SNPs in European samples were successfully imputed. No significant association was observed after correction for multiple testing. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that candidate variants implicated in the pathogenesis of ADHD do not play a substantial role in PD.</abstracttext>]",['https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12402-017-0219-8']

During dialysis, when blood flow decreases, it may retrograde from the peripheral artery through the palmar arch to the arterial anastomosis site. Arterial steal syndrome (ASS) causes distal hypoperfusion, resulting in hand ischemia or extremity pain and edema. Hence, this study proposes the bilateral photoplethysmography (PPG) for ASS detection in arteriovenous fistulas. The decision-making quantizer utilizes the fractional-order feature extraction method and a non-cooperative game (NCG) framework to evaluate the ASS risk level. Bilateral asynchronous PPG signals have significant differences in the rise time and amplitude in relation to the degree of stenosis. The fractional-order self-synchronization error formulation is a feature extraction method used to quantify bilateral differences in blood flow changes between the dexter and sinister PPG signals. The NCG model as a method of decision-making is then employed to evaluate the ASS risk level. Using an acoustic Doppler measurement, the resistive (Res) index is also used to evaluate the vascular access stenosis at the arterial anastomosis site. In contrast with alternative methods including the high-sensitivity C-reactive protein level or Res index, our experimental results indicate that the proposed decision-making quantizer is more efficient in preventing ASS during hemodialysis treatment.</abstracttext>]",['https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11517-016-1503-z']

MWNTs with different degrees of acid oxidation may have different bioreactivities and propensities to aggregate in the extracellular environment, and both individualised and aggregated MWNTs may be expected to be found in the brain. Before practical application, it is vital to understand how both aggregates and individual MWNTs will interact with local phagocytic immune cells, the microglia, and ultimately to determine their biopersistence in the brain. The processing of extra- and intracellular MWNTs (both pristine and when acid oxidised) by microglia was characterised across multiple length scales by correlating a range of dynamic, quantitative and multi-scale techniques, including: UV-vis spectroscopy, light microscopy, focussed ion beam scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. Dynamic, live cell imaging revealed the ability of microglia to break apart and internalise micron-sized extracellular agglomerates of acid oxidised MWNTs, but not pristine MWNTs. The total amount of MWNTs internalised by, or strongly bound to, microglia was quantified as a function of time. Neither the significant uptake of oxidised MWNTs, nor the incomplete uptake of pristine MWNTs affected microglial viability, pro-inflammatory cytokine release or nitric oxide production. However, after 24 h exposure to pristine MWNTs, a significant increase in the production of reactive oxygen species was observed. Small aggregates and individualised oxidised MWNTs were present in the cytoplasm and vesicles, including within multilaminar bodies, after 72 h. Some evidence of morphological damage to oxidised MWNT structure was observed including highly disordered graphitic structures, suggesting possible biodegradation. This work demonstrates the utility of dynamic, quantitative and multi-scale techniques in understanding the different cellular processing routes of functionalised nanomaterials.

We identify genetic risk profiles based on GWAS variants associated with schizophrenia and Crohn's disease as significantly associated with risk of PD. Conditional analyses adjusting for SNPs near loci associated with PD and schizophrenia or PD and Crohn's disease suggest that spatially overlapping loci associated with schizophrenia and PD account for most of the shared comorbidity, while variation outside of known proximal loci shared by PD and Crohn's disease accounts for their shared genetic comorbidity. We examine brain methylation and expression signatures proximal to schizophrenia and Crohn's disease loci to infer functional changes in the brain associated with the variants contributing to genetic comorbidity. We compare our results with a systematic review of epidemiological literature, while the findings are dissimilar to a degree; marginal genetic associations corroborate the directionality of associations across genetic and epidemiological data.

The activity of MASP-1 in the peripheral blood has been identified previously as a highly significant predictor of the severity of liver fibrosis in hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, but not in liver disease of other aetiologies. In this study we tested the hypotheses that expression of MASP-1 may promote disease progression in HCV disease by direct activation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) and may additionally be up-regulated by HCV. In order to do so, we utilized a model for the maintenance of primary human HSC in the quiescent state by culture on basement membrane substrate prior to stimulation. In comparison to controls, recombinant MASP-1 stimulated quiescent human HSCs to differentiate to the activated state as assessed by both morphology and up-regulation of HSC activation markers α-smooth muscle actin and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1. Further, the expression of MASP-1 was up-regulated significantly by HCV infection in hepatocyte cell lines. These observations suggest a new role for MASP-1 and provide a possible mechanistic link between high levels of MASP-1 and the severity of disease in HCV infection. Taken together with previous clinical observations, our new findings suggest that the balance of MASP-1 activity may be proinflammatory and act to accelerate fibrosis progression in HCV liver disease. </abstracttext>]","['http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/cei.12174', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmid/23841802/']"

The multivariate analysis of the AAO was a mixed linear model, with COMT genotype and gender considered as fixed effects and cohort and cohort-gender interaction as random effects. COMT genotype was coded as a quantitative variable, assuming a codominant genetic effect. The distribution of the COMT polymorphism was not significantly different in patients and controls (p=0.22).

Analysing two independent GWA studies, we identified that both had a significant excess in the number of functional categories enriched for PD-associated genes (minimum P = 0.014 and P = 0.006, respectively). Moreover, 58 categories were significantly enriched for associated genes in both GWA studies (P &lt; 0.001), implicating genes involved in the 'regulation of leucocyte/lymphocyte activity' and also 'cytokine-mediated signalling' as conferring an increased susceptibility to PD. These results were unaltered by the exclusion of all 178 genes that were present at the 18 genomic regions previously reported to be strongly associated with PD (including the HLA locus).

We found that an effective shielding of triplet energy transfer from a high E(T) phosphor guest to a low E(T) polymer host is possible upon introducing dense side chains to the polymer to block direct contact from the guest such that the possibility of Dexter energy transfer between them is reduced to a minimum. Together with energy level matching to allow charge trapping on the guest, high device efficiency can be achieved. The extent of shielding for the systems of phenylene-based conjugated structures from iridium complexes follows the sequence di-substituted (octoxyl chain) in the para position (dC8OPPP) is greater than monosubstituted (mC8OPPP) and the PPPs with longer side chains are much higher than a phenylene tetramer (P4) with two short methyl groups. Further, capping the dialkoxyl-susbstituents with a carbazole (Cz) moiety (CzPPP) provides enhanced extent of shielding. Excellent device efficiency of 30 cd/A (8.25%) for a green electrophosphorescent device can be achieved with CzPPP as a host, which is higher than that of dC8OPPP as host (15 cd/A). The efficiency is higher than those of high E(T) conjugated polymers, poly(3,6-carbazole) derivatives, as hosts (23 cd/A). This observation suggests a new route for molecular design of electroluminescent polymers as a host for a phosphorescent dopant.</abstracttext>]",['https://dx.doi.org/10.1021/ja076413i']

To break the limit, hUCB as a novel source of hUCB-derived stromal cells was incorporated in an attempt to expand CD34+ cells from hUCB in vitro. Cord blood CD34 cells were separated by MACS system. HUCB-derived stromal cells were cultured by the Dexter system and characterized by morphologic, immunophenotypical, and functional analysis. We studied the effects of hUCB-derived stromal cells, cytokines, and hUCB-derived stromal cells combined with cytokines on expansion of hUCB CD34 cells. The CD34+ cells were assessed for the degree of expansion and the number of colony-forming units in semisolid culture. Our research found that hUCB-derived stromal cells were mainly composed of three kinds of cell components, with CD106, CD29, CD44, CD45, CD50, CD68, CD31, Fn, Lm, and collagen IV positive, but CD34 negative immunophenotype. Functionally, it was discovered by cell cycle and growth curve analyses that the capability of colony and parietal layer formation of hUCB-derived stromal cells was poorer than that of BM stromal cells, and the doubling time of hUCB-derived stromal cells was longer than that of BM stromal cells. It was indicated by ELISA and RT-PCR that hUCB-derived stromal cells express higher level of TPO and less GM-CSF and SCF than BM stromal cell.

Discrete-event computer simulation over many years was used to represent surgical suites with an unchanging cancellation rate. Because the true cancellation rate was fixed, the accuracy of the statistical methods could be determined. Cancellations caused by medical events, rare events, cases lasting longer than scheduled, and full postanesthesia or intensive care unit beds were modeled. We found that applying Student's two-sample t-test to the transformation of the numbers of cases and canceled cases from each of six 4-wk periods was valid for most conditions. We recommend that clinicians and managers use this method in their quality monitoring reports. The other methods gave inaccurate results. For example, using chi(2) or Fisher's exact test, hospitals may erroneously determine that cancellation rates have increased when they really are unchanged.

This activity itself failed to stimulate in vitro granulocyte-macrophage colony (CFU-GM) formation but could increase the number of colonies induced by colony-stimulating factors (CSFs). CPA was produced by the adherent stromal cells but not by the nonadherent cells. No CPA could be detected in cultures of pure marrow fibroblasts, nor was it secreted by the stromal cells following macrophage depletion. In contrast, a large amount of CPA was found in cultures of isolated macrophages, suggesting that marrow macrophages may be the main cell source of CPA. Although colony formation was augmented by adding CPA in combination with various CSFs, the colony type induced by CPA plus CSF was no different from that of CSF alone. Preincubation of bone marrow (BM) cells with CPA at 37 degrees C for 24 hours before using in clonal culture assay resulted in a marked colony enhancement. Furthermore, colony formation by 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)-treated marrow cells could be induced by granulocyte-macrophage (GM)-CSF plus CPA but not by GM-CSF alone. These results suggest that CPA may act on early developing hematopoietic stem cells to induce them to differentiate into more mature myeloid progenitor cells capable of responding to CSF stimulation. CPA was nondialyzable and stable under heat (56 degrees C for 30 minutes) and freeze/thawing (3 times). Its activity was acid-labile (pH 2.0) but relatively alkaline-resistant (pH 11.0). When treated with enzymes, CPA was sensitive to trypsin and bacterial protease but not to neuraminidase. In addition, the activity of CPA could be abrogated by anti-CPA antiserum but remained unchanged after treatment with antibodies to other murine hematopoietic synergizing/stimulating factors, including interleukin-1 (IL-1), IL-3, IL-4, IL-6, and stem cell factor (SCF).</abstracttext>]",[]

Agents were administered i.p. on a daily x 9 schedule when mice developed tumors that were 50-100 mg in size. Drugs which are clinically effective against breast cancer were quite efficacious in the transgenic model at their maximum tolerated dose. Doxorubicin produced excellent responses in tumor-bearing transgenic mice, with several mammary carcinomas undergoing tumor shrinkage. Two anthrapyrazoles, DuP 937 and DuP 941, novel anticancer drugs with phase 2 activity against breast cancer, were as effective as doxorubicin in the oncomice. Mitoxantrone, a synthetic agent with some properties similar to the anthracyclines, also had antitumor activity, but not as pronounced as obtained with doxorubicin or the anthrapyrazoles. Cisplatin, a drug with limited use in human breast cancer, only caused modest antitumor responses. A computerized data analysis method based on the area under the tumor growth curve was developed to better quantitate the data and provide statistical information. This quantitative analysis confirmed the high statistical significance of the activity of doxorubicin or the anthrapyrazoles in the ras transgenic model, and defined an excellent dose response relationship for each drug tested. Our results suggest that the ras transgenic model may be useful for identifying drugs that have efficacy for breast cancer in women.</abstracttext>]",[]
"Elliott BE, Tam SP, <b>Dexter</b> D, <b>Chen</b> ZQ.",1992,1317363,Capacity of adipose tissue to promote growth and metastasis of a murine mammary carcinoma: effect of estrogen and progesterone.,International journal of cancer,"[<abstracttext>Previously we have shown that a murine mammary carcinoma cell line, designated SPI, grows and metastasizes more efficiently in the mammary gland than in the subcutis. In this report, we examine the tissue specificity of this phenomenon. Our results show that SPI cells grow best in the mesenteric and ovarian fat pads and well in the mammary gland, but very poorly in the subcutis or peritoneal cavity. Massive dissemination of tumors from the ovarian and mesenteric sites occurs to the liver, spleen and diaphragm. In contrast, metastases from the mammary site occur primarily in the lung. Co-transplantation of a threshold number of SPI cells with mammary or ovarian fat fragments into the subcutis results in increased tumor growth, whereas very few tumors form in sham controls receiving no fat fragments. Removal of the ovaries of donor and recipient mice abrogates tumor growth in adipose tissue transplants. Estrogen can stimulate growth of SPI in adipose tissue sites, whereas progesterone inhibits growth. In contrast, in vivo growth of a stable metastatic variant selected from SPI cells was not inhibited by progesterone. SPI cells growing in ovarian and mesenteric fat pads showed increased expression of estrogen receptors and progesterone receptors, as well as detectable levels of epidermal-growth-factor receptors, whereas receptor levels decreased to baseline on tumors in the subcutis. The levels of estrogen-receptor mRNA reflect the corresponding functional expression of receptors; this finding suggests that the regulation of estrogen-receptor expression in this system is, at least in part, at the mRNA level. Our results are consistent with the model that adipose tissue exerts an estrogen-dependent positive regulatory effect on primary SPI tumor growth, and promotes the formation of metastases.</abstracttext>]",['http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/openurl?genre=article&sid=nlm:pubmed&issn=0020-7136&date=1992&volume=51&issue=3&spage=416']
"Wang SY, Su CY, Hsu ML, <b>Chen</b> LY, Tzeng CH, Ho CK.",1991,1991494,Effect of lipopolysaccharide on the production of colony-stimulating factors by the stromal cells in long-term bone marrow culture.,Experimental hematology,"[<abstracttext>The production of colony-stimulating factors (CSFs) by murine bone marrow stromal cells was studied with Dexter long-term bone marrow culture (LTBMC). For induction of CSF release, various concentrations (0.5-40.0 microgram/ml) of bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) were added to nonrecharged 3-week-old LTBMCs consisting of an intact or macrophage-depleted adherent cell layer. The depletion of monocytes/macrophages from freshly prepared bone marrow cell suspension was performed by carbonyl-iron incorporation before establishment of LTBMC. The supernatants (Sup) of normal LTBMCs contained a low level of macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) that was produced by the adherent cells but not by the nonadherent cell elements. No colony inhibitor was found in the Sup of LTBMCs, whereas a colony-promoting activity (CPA) was detected in medium conditioned by the adherent marrow cells (AC-CM). CPA could enhance the colony formation of myeloid progenitor cells when used in combination with recombinant murine granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). The production of CSFs peaked at about 24 h after refeeding, but it then declined to only half the optimal activity at the end of the week. Addition of LPS to the intact LTBMC invariably increased the production of a GM-CSF-like cytokine. The release of this cytokine was dose dependent and peaked at a dosage of 20 micrograms/ml of LPS at 24 h after treatment. In contrast, macrophage-depleted marrow-adherent cells failed to respond to LPS for CSF secretion. These results suggest that LPS can stimulate marrow macrophages to directly release CSF or to potentiate the production of CSF by other stromal cells.</abstracttext>]",[]

Sixty-nine quinoline 4-carboxylic acid analogs were analyzed as inhibitors of L1210 dihydroorotate dehydrogenase. This structure-activity relationship study identified three critical regions of brequinar sodium and its analogs, where specific substitutions are required for the inhibition of the activity of dihydroorotate dehydrogenase. The three principal regions are: (i) the C(2) position where bulky hydrophobic substituents are necessary, (ii) the C(4) position which has a strict requirement for the carboxylic acid and its corresponding salts, and (iii) the benzo portion of the quinoline ring with appropriate substitutions. These results will be useful in the elucidation of the precise nature of the interaction between brequinar sodium and dihydroorotate dehydrogenase.</abstracttext>]",[]

Using monoclonal antibodies directed against von Willebrand factor (vWF) and against membrane antigens (EN-4 and PAL-E), a low percentage--usually less than 1% of stromal cells--of ECs was detected in all confluent cultures established from 11 different bone marrow samples. Generally these cells are not associated directly with the areas of myelopoiesis (""cobblestone areas""). ECs cannot be demonstrated in the adherent layer of most young, non-confluent, and of some old, HLTBMCs. In some instances, morphological features suggestive of dynamic behavior were seen (sprouting, canal formation). In addition, a very low proportion of vWF-positive megakaryocytic cells was found in 4 of 11 cultures, always in direct contact with the stromal fibroblastic cells.</abstracttext>]",[]

Within 1 h Brequinar distributed to the tumor and all other tissues studied. The tumor-to-blood drug concentration ratios ranged from 0.19 to 0.41. Radioactivity in the liver and small intestine at 1 h accounted for 17% and 13%, respectively, of the dose given.

Cells exposed to NSC 368390 became depleted in intracellular pools of uridine 5'-triphosphate and cytidine 5'-triphosphate. Both uridine 5'-triphosphate and cytidine 5'-triphosphate were decreased to 50% of levels in control cells at 3 h and were undetectable at 15 h after addition of 25 microM of NSC 368390 to the cultures. Similar effects were observed in L1210 leukemia cells. Addition of 0.1 mM of uridine or cytidine restored intracellular pools of uridine 5'-triphosphate and cytidine 5'-triphosphate to control levels and rescued clone A cells from NSC 368390 cytotoxicity. Addition of uridine circumvented NSC 368390 cytotoxicity in L1210 cells, but addition of cytidine did not. This result is consistent with the fact that L1210 cells lack cytidine deaminase and thus cannot form uridine or its anabolites from cytidine. These results indicated that NSC 368390 inhibits a step in the de novo biosynthetic pathway leading to uridine 5'-monophosphate. Therefore, the effects of NSC 368390 on the six enzymes that comprise the de novo pathway leading to the formation of uridine 5'-monophosphate were examined. The results showed that NSC 368390 was a potent inhibitor of dihydroorotate dehydrogenase, the fourth enzyme in the pathway; thus, this study demonstrates that NSC 368390 exerts its tumoricidal effect by inhibiting a step in de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis resulting in the depletion of critical precursors for RNA and DNA synthesis.</abstracttext>]",['http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=3019518']

Marrow CFUE and BFUE were decreased at concentrations of lithium greater than or equal to 0.5 meq/L. In vivo (0.5-5.0 meq/L i.p.), lithium produced similar results to those obtained in vitro with striking CFUC enhancement. Serum from these lithium-treated mice contained increased colony stimulating factor (CSF). In the Dexter continuous marrow culture system, lithium stimulated increased CFUC production from the non-adherent fraction. These in vitro nd vivo studies document lithium's ability to modulate hematopoiesis by influencing pluripotential and committed stem cell proliferation and differentiation towards granulopoiesis, apparently at the expense of erythropoiesis. Mechanisms of this modulation are discussed.</abstracttext>]",[]
